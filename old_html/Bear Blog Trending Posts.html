<p>Seriously? After everyone has come to an agreement, you want to be so entitled and disagree—just because it <em>“doesn’t feel right”</em>? What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bgkvjDPY/IMG-0593-v1.jpg" alt="Evolvers" /></p>
<p>That’s exactly how I felt about a colleague of mine. To me, he was just being stubborn and unreasonable, refusing to go along with the team. But man, was I wrong.</p>
<p>One day, we had to decide whether to expel a student whose misbehavior had crossed the line. Six out of seven teachers agreed: he had to go. But this colleague of mine? He shook his head and said, <em>“It just doesn’t feel right.”</em> My blood boiled.</p>
<p>Then he explained, “He’s a troublemaker, yes. But that’s only because he comes from a broken family. If we’re not here to support him, who will?” The room went silent. In the end, the student stayed and started weekly counseling.</p>
<p>That moment changed how I saw him forever. It also showed me the difference between a Leader and an Evolver—those who seek consensus versus those who stand for what’s right, even when they stand alone.</p>
<p>To understand those terms, you first need to grasp the difference between <a href="https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/class/type-strategy">belonging vs. significance</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my <a href="https://josephlee.bearblog.dev/blog/">past blog posts</a>, I’ve covered <a href="https://www.personality.ninja/nxt-core/class/introduction">The Four Primal Human Desires</a> and the contrast between <a href="https://josephlee.bearblog.dev/variety-vs-certainty/">variety vs. certainty</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dive into belonging vs. significance. Do your decisions revolve around gaining a sense of belonging? Or personal significance?</p>
<p>Imagine a leader in a group. Their job is to constantly look after their team in order to keep everyone together. That’s why, in <a href="https://www.personality.ninja/">NXT Personality Ninja</a>, people who seek belonging are called <a href="https://www.personality.ninja/knowledge-base/class/type-strategy/leader">Leaders</a>. (This doesn’t mean they’re always in leadership roles, but they act the way a leader would—focusing on others.)</p>
<p>On the flip side, those who crave significance are called <a href="https://www.personality.ninja/knowledge-base/class/type-strategy/evolver">Evolvers</a>. To stand out, you have to be different, which often means pushing yourself to grow. That’s why people who prioritize significance tend to value personal growth, always pushing themselves to evolve.</p>

<em>Honestly... the guy in the suit stands out more than Big Bird! 😂</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Leader vs. Evolver</h2>
<p>So what differences do Leaders and Evolvers have? Let's take a look:</p>
<h4>1. Fitting In vs. Being Yourself</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaders care a lot about what others think of them. They pay close attention to social norms and expectations, adjusting their behavior to align with what’s considered acceptable. Their sense of belonging comes from meeting these external standards.</li>
<li>Evolvers, on the other hand, focus on staying true to themselves. They don’t shape their opinions or actions based on what’s popular—they go with what feels right or reasonable to them. Instead of adjusting to fit in, they’d rather stand apart and own who they are.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Group Consensus vs. Personal Opinion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaders value harmony and teamwork. They consider what others want before deciding, seeking feedback to maintain group support. Even if they don’t ask directly, they factor in what others might think.</li>
<li>Evolvers put their own opinions first. They make decisions based on what makes sense to them, even if most people disagree. They respect others’ views, but they won’t change their stance just to go with the crowd.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Wanting Unity vs. Wanting Individuality</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaders love when everyone is on the same page. They don’t mind ignoring their own wants for the group’s sake and expect others to do the same. To them, sticking together matters more than personal differences.</li>
<li>Evolvers, on the other hand, like to be themselves. They don’t expect everyone to agree or act the same way, and they respect when others do their own thing too. They’d rather embrace differences than force unity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Fear of Losing the Group vs. Fear of Losing Yourself</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaders worry about being left out. Their biggest fear is losing their place in the group, so they spend a lot of time wondering, “Do they like me?” or “Will they judge me?” They want to be accepted, so they’re always aware of how they come across.</li>
<li>Evolvers fear losing their sense of self. They care more about staying true to who they are than about fitting in. Instead of worrying about what others think, they ask themselves, “Am I being real?” They’d rather stand alone than change just to be liked.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Talking About Others vs. Talking About Yourself</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaders tend to talk about others—friends, family, coworkers—rather than themselves. If you ask about their vacation, they might share a funny story about someone they went with instead of their own experience.</li>
<li>Evolvers, on the other hand, naturally talk about their own thoughts and feelings. If you ask them about their family or friends, they might still bring the conversation back to how they personally felt or what they learned from the experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So, are you a Leader or an Evolver?</p>
<p>Before you decide, don’t just use a single moment as conclusive evidence. Leaders might sometimes stand for their personal values and opinions too, just as how Evolvers care about the thoughts of those who matter deeply to them.</p>
<p>But as a general pattern—do you tend to consider what others think? Or do you check in with your own beliefs and reasoning first?</p>
<p>Recognizing these differences is the first step to overcoming our negative tendencies. Unhealthy Leaders may come across as fake or overly eager to please, while unhealthy Evolvers might seem selfish, putting their own wants above the group’s needs.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of these tendencies helps us break out of autopilot, so that we can take small, conscious steps each day to make our lives better, and a little happier.</p>

              <summary><p>i stopped being a bookaholic like I used to three years ago.</p>
<p>my excuses were the usual:</p>
<ul>
<li>too busy to sit down with a good story</li>
<li>eye strain from staring at a computer screen trying to read PDFs (i still struggle with this when i try to read papers plz help)</li>
<li>sometimes i even blame covid vaccine for messing with my focus</li>
</ul>
<p>u know how you just spit out reasons to dodge what you used to love?
that was just me, making a little excuse fort to hide in.</p>
<p>it's not that i wasn't reading anything -- but i wasn't reading enough.</p>
<p>last week, my homie slid me his old Kobo Glo e-reader.</p>
<p>that thing killed every excuse I had.</p>
<p>after using it for a week now, i feel like a new man.</p>
<p>i also didn't code that weekend, and spent the time just reading.</p>
<p>tkhyel meaya everything i said before just sounded dumb once I was actually turning pages again.</p>
<p>now i’m back at it, actually enjoying reading again.</p>
<p>started with some fiction and thrillers in arabic and english..</p>
<p>i’ve also been digging into more technical books (not ai related)</p>
<p>WARNING: it's not because some gadget waved a magic wand.</p>
<p>it's also not because an e-reader is all you need.</p>
<p>an act was all i needed (and definitely all you need)</p>
<p>my goal from this whole reading is to understand stuff that makes you think differently, and builds you up a little f other domains you're not even aware of..</p>
<p>basically: polymath is the goal.</p>
<p>the most ambitious ppl are the ones who are &quot;curious&quot;, aka polymath.</p>
<p>i’m not there yet, but i’m moving.</p>
<p>and in my case, reading will definitely help..</p>
<p>it's kinda relative i would say..</p>
<p>ambition looks different depending on where you’re standing.</p>
<p>for some, it’s <a href="tab:https://x.com/hud_zah/status/1827057785995141558?lang=en">building a nuclear reactor in a bedroom</a>; for others, it’s figuring out how to live a life that doesn’t feel like a treadmill.</p>
<p>what's interesting is: sometimes you don’t realize how much you miss something til it lands back in your lap.</p>
<p>life’s too short to let good things slip away behind weak excuses.</p>
<p>note to self 3wtani:</p>
<p>find out what you love (or used to love) and make it work again.
that’s it.</p>

<summary>Update - 7th March 2025 at 04:56</summary>
After posting this, I spent the rest of the day refreshing the discover page to see its ranking and likes. Learning from <a href="https://bluelander.bearblog.dev/bye-the-numbers/">matt bee's parallel experience with metrics</a>, I'm going to filter my own blog off my discovery page (realistically, I will undo this a lot, but the friction might at least give me pause). Now to find a way to stop myself from abusing inspect element...
<details style="margin: 0 15px;">
<summary>Another update - 7th March 2025 at 11:19</summary>
I've filtered myself out and then used uBlock Origin to block the element. Yay for definitely having very strong built-in self-control.

<summary>ANOTHER another update - 8th March 2025 at 04:21</summary>
The irony of my post about how I'm insane about metrics being the one to put me on Trending is not lost on me. Either way, thank you for reading! (I know I'm not meant to look but I obviously was going to. #3 last I checked, what!!!)
</details>
</details>
</details>

<p>I'm way too obsessed with checking how my posts are doing. Whenever I put something out, especially something I put any amount of effort into, I check it again and again whenever I'm reminded of it. Where there are likes and dislikes to be had, I am watching.</p>
<p>So when I realised that there were upvotes<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> on <a href="https://www.bearblog.dev/">bearblog.dev</a> (AND a <a href="https://www.bearblog.dev/discover/">trending page</a> where that number mattered), I was hooked. I'd type in my own URL over and over again to look at the number under my posts, to see if anyone else thought what I had to say was good. I was reading them over again trying to figure out if they would hold someone's attention long enough to get to the good parts, if I'd like it if I was on the other side of the screen, always changing some things each time when they inevitably didn't hold up to the scrutiny. I realised then that I was being kind of dumb with it. I have two posts up total, have only shared the link to my blog with 1 person, and the kicker: it's not something I even care about.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Part of the reason I wanted to make an online space of my own is to get myself away from that checking behaviour. In my head, likes appeal to to humans' social needs because it delivers an imitation of the rewards of a social interaction without the interaction itself, telling you you've been heard and accepted, that you're <em>in</em>.  But really, so many people like and reply to things for so many reasons that it's basically meaningless, and I've had my experiences going viral enough times to know it's mostly luck that determines that the right people see it at the right time to start the popularity ball rolling. Despite knowing all this, I still check.</p>
<p>I don't like it, but right now I'm a kind of non-Newtonian person, only solid when someone pushes back. It's sometimes great (like last week, when I floated through the day on the glowing feedback I got on an essay), but it's mostly terrifying, because if I'm not constantly pushed around by the world, I'll disappear down a storm drain. I'm sure it's a necessarily human thing, to want to wait for approval before really letting yourself stand behind your own work, and to want to have yourself unambiguously approved, but it's not helpful when I'm using the performance of my internet doings as a proxy measure for my worth as a person.</p>
<p>All this to say: I've taken off the upvote count on my blog<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> because I want to keep this space for myself. I don't need to know if there's an amount<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> of people who like a given post, because it's just for me to put it out there. What other people think about it is none of my business.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>

              <summary><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many GRPO reproductions for LLM reinforcement learning available online lack useful intuitions or recommendations regarding hyperparameters and reward shaping.</p>
<p>Most examples focus on GSM8k or similar math problems - tasks with clear right/wrong answers. Additionally, demonstrations seen so far primarily use models smaller than ~7B, and don't demonstrate realistic failure modes when it comes to the learning dynamics of smaller models.</p>
<p>My goal was to tackle a more generalizable and difficult problem: improving generalized semantic judgements where the &quot;correct&quot; answer requires <strong>subjective evaluation</strong>, not just calculation. This is a more diverse task compared to math-based problem solving, and helps illustrate how GRPO develops problem-solving strategies in other domains.</p>
<h2>Task Description</h2>
<p>The task involves training a model to evaluate two pieces of text. One of the texts has been subtly augmented by a LLM (specifically, the larger 14B variant of my <a href="https://huggingface.co/Quest-AI/quest-corruption-7b-s375-v3-GRPO">corruption models</a>). The model must provide notes and a subsequent judgment afterwards in consecutive XML tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/r5dm86.png" alt="GRPO Task Overview" /></p>
<h2>Example Format</h2>
<p>The base model is provided a system prompt that establishes the expected template, as well as two randomly ordered A/B samples containing &quot;real&quot; vs &quot;synthetic&quot; samples for the input:</p>
<pre><code>REQUEST: You are to judge the better of the two samples and determine which of the following samples is better using a short judgement that is no longer than (and no shorter than) exactly 128 tokens.

Respond with an exactly 128 tokens tag labeled &lt;notes&gt; that contains your notes, and then &lt;judgement&gt; which is just the letter that you are picking.

For example:

JUDGE: &lt;notes&gt;
Sample A is superior to Sample B... (example notes)
&lt;/notes&gt;
&lt;judgement&gt;A&lt;/judgement&gt;

Now, it is your turn.

[Sample A]:
Included is a pre-test, post-test, and vocabulary quiz on the 8th grade math standard functions (8.F). 1.) Determine if a graph represents a function 2.) State the domain and range of a relation 3.) Plot points on a graph to determine if the table represents a function 4.) State if a function is decreasing, increasing, or constant 5.) Determine the output of a function machine 6.) Determine the recursive and explicit equation 7.) Determine the minimum, maximum, increasing interval, and decreasing interval of a graph 8.) Determine the rate of change, initial value, independent value, and dependent variable given a graph 9.) Sketch a graph given a situation The vocabulary included is dependent, output, function, domain, range, decreasing function, input, range, non-linear function, relation, increasing function, and function notation. Total Pages: 9 (18 including answer key) Answer Key: Included Document File: PDF

[Sample B]:
Included is a pre-test, post-test, and vocabulary quiz on the 8th grade math standard functions (8.F). 1.) Determine if a graph represents a function 2.) State the domain and range of a relation 3.) Plot points on a graph to determine if the table represents a function 4.) State if a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant 5.) Determine the output of a function given 6.) Determine the input of a function given 7.) Determine a function rule given ordered pairs or a table of values. 8.) Graph functions using a table of values and determine a trend line in a graph 9.) Write a data table situation The vocabulary included is dependent, output, function, domain, range, decreasing function, input, range, non-linear function, relation, increasing function, and function notation. Total Pages: 9 (18 including answer key) Answer Key: Included Document File: PDF

JUDGE:
</code></pre>
<p>A correct output follows this structure:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;notes&gt;
Sample A provides more specific and thoroughly defined tasks. It mentions &quot;function machine,&quot; &quot;recursive and explicit equation,&quot; and detailed graph analysis with &quot;minimum, maximum&quot; and intervals. Sample B contains incomplete phrases like &quot;output of a function given&quot; without completing the thought, making it less coherent and precise than Sample A.
&lt;/notes&gt;
&lt;judgement&gt;A&lt;/judgement&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Hyperparameter Observations</h2>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/szqgxg.png" alt="Comparison of decaying rewards" /></p>
<h3>Learning Rate Schedulers</h3>
<p>When hyperparameter tuning, I observed that cosine or linear decaying learning rates (particularly with fast warmup) do not work well with GRPO.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/vwdx8d.png" alt="Learning Rate Comparison" /></p>
<p>What worked best was constant with a warm up phase with lower learning rates: <code>lr_scheduler_type=&quot;constant_with_warmup&quot;</code></p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/on8txs.png" alt="Constant with Warmup Learning Rate" /></p>
<h3>Gradient Clipping</h3>
<p>For consistency, setting <code>max_grad_norm</code> to 0.2 as a default seems most effective (this is also the default clipping ratio in PPO, &amp; I have done SFT runs in the past where 0.2 had the lowest loss).</p>
<p>This value can be reduced if necessary for stability.</p>
<h2>Reward Construction Decisions</h2>
<h3>Power Scaling the Judgement Reward</h3>
<p>For this task, there are two possible valid choices: A/B. Base models (Qwen2.5 series, mostly 7b/14b runs) begin with slightly worse than average reward; 14b was closer to 50/50 (equivalent to random chance).</p>
<p>I wanted to try something different for reward scaling rather than naively using the percentage of accurate judgements. If we simply took the raw accuracy and used it as reward (e.g., 0.4 for 40% accuracy), I thought it might not create enough pressure for improvement.</p>
<p>My idea was to apply a power function (specifically x⁴) to the reward scaling. Specifically, the approach scales down rewards for correct answers when the model's overall batch accuracy is low, while substantially increasing the reward as accuracy improves.</p>
<p>The implementation I tried rescales individual correct judgments based on the overall batch performance. This means that the actual reward value assigned to each correct answer changes as the model improves on average, but I haven't rigorously tested if this scaling is actually better than alternatives.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 50% accuracy, correct answers get 0.125 reward</li>
<li>At 80% accuracy, correct answers get 0.512 reward</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/mbqk3p.png" alt="Power Scaling Function" /></p>
<h3>XML Formatting Bonus</h3>
<p>Enforcing the XML schema (notes followed by a judgement) is something we want to incentivize. However, I wanted to avoid giving partial reward to responses with wrong judgements.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing is enforcing the formatting reward as a flat 0.2 bonus that only applies when the judgement is also correct.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this is because, if done this way, the &quot;chain of desirability&quot; (according to our reward specifications) looks something along the lines of:</p>
<p>correct judgements &amp; formatting &gt; correct judgements, wrong formatting &gt; wrong judgements (formatting irrelevant)</p>
<h3>Length as a Bonus Reward</h3>
<p>The third reward was a bit of an afterthought, but it's a non-linear scaling that favors <notes> tags with a length closely clustered to the range of ~128 tokens.</p>
<p>Much like the formatting reward, this reward only applies if the judgement is correct.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/mo6b8r.png" alt="Token Length Example" /></p>
<h2>Scaling and the Impact on Judgement</h2>
<p>While Qwen2.5 3b can climb the hill, it does it significantly more slowly compared to the 7b or 14b base models.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ggu6x3.png" alt="Scaling Comparison Between Model Sizes" /></p>
<p>I think it's a little important to harp on the fact that the 7b base adapts <em>so much faster</em> here; it's to the degree where the Qwen 1.5b was only slightly worse compared to the 3b, while the 7b saw a substantial improvement.</p>
<h2>Observed Reasoning Patterns</h2>
<p>Analysis of the highest reward samples from the GRPO judge model revealed &quot;templated&quot; reasoning patterns:</p>
<h3>Template Structure</h3>
<p>The highest reward samples seem to follow a specific reasoning template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model starts with &quot;Both of these...&quot; followed by an explanation of what the samples share</li>
<li>Then follows with &quot;However,&quot; to contrast differences between examples</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/jbcb95.png" alt="Example of template structure" /></p>
<h3>Ambiguity Recognition</h3>
<p>There is more acknowledgement of ambiguity leading up to the judgement in some of the highest reward samples.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ev0q6u.jpeg" alt="Example showing ambiguity acknowledgment" /></p>
<h3>Reinforcement Phrases</h3>
<p>&quot;Additionally,&quot; is another anchor phrase that the model uses to reinforce the judgement in cases where it seems more confident than usual.</p>

              <summary><p>Tired of reading the same people on the trending page here on Bearblog? Me too.</p>
<p>No shade—their blogs are really cool, and there’s no doubt they’re great writers. They’re trending for a reason. But there are also hundreds of blogs that haven’t been discovered yet because we spend too much time reading the ones we’re already comfortable with. Maybe some of us even have a <em>comfort blogger</em> without realizing it. And that’s totally fine—we don’t have to stop reading them! But we can open ourselves up to reading others and finding our next favorite post.</p>
<p>That’s what the Most Recent tab is for! But sometimes, there’s just so much to read that we might be missing out on a lot. That’s why I’ve decided to recommend some posts I’ve discovered in this feed over the past few days. But not just that—I’ll also share why I enjoyed them and what I got out of reading them.</p>
<p>I got this idea from <a href="tab:https://winther.sysctl.dk/readworthy-blogposts-i-have-found-recently-2/">winther's blog</a>, where he regularly shares interesting posts he finds—not just on Bearblog, but across the small internet in general.</p>
<p>==DISCLAIMER:== If you’re the author of any of these posts and have an issue with it being shared, please reach out, and I’ll remove it ASAP. I completely understand and respect the desire to write in full anonymity.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://betaveros.bearblog.dev/how-to-reply-to-a-post/">how to reply to a post</a> — A reflection on the different ways we can respond to other bloggers' posts and the impact our responses might have—reactions that, depending on how the original author or others perceive them, could even push the author to delete their original content.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://wantless.bearblog.dev/the-wisdom-of-addiction/">The Wisdom of Addiction</a> — What do we think when we’re desperate to fall back into something we’re trying so hard to avoid? And how do we trick ourselves into tasting, even just a little, what has hurt us so much? This is a beautifully written post about the allure of addiction and the reward behind enduring withdrawal.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://dioscuria.com/the-departure-of-our-children/">on the departure of ourselves into adulting</a> — Leaving the &quot;nest&quot; is one of life’s stages that we all go through at some point when independent life calls. But what about those we leave behind in the place we grew up? This personal reflection explores the impact of our departure on those who raised us with love. Also, the design of this blog is <strong>AMAZING</strong>—I wish my blog looked even half as good.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://neuropurgatory.bearblog.dev/things-that-i-will-never-get-to-do-again/">things that i will never get to do again</a> — Growing up isn’t just about aging; it’s about stopping doing certain things—sometimes because progress forces us to. We stop doing what, in one way or another, becomes obsolete in society. A post about the nostalgia of growing up in the ’90s—one I can definitely relate to.</p>

<p>As I have been writing about lately, we are in the process of detangling ourselves from big tech. Both of us have used Gmail for many years, and now we want to stop. It's going to be a long process. I studied this a bit and knew what I was getting myself into. There are some things I can share that will make this process easier for anyone who undertakes it.</p>
<p>I have my own domain. Anyone can buy one. They are just a few dollars a year. Most email services that you have to pay for, even iCloud from Apple, allow you to use your own domain when you set them up. The benefit to doing this is that if you ever want to move to another email service, you can take your domain with you, and you'll never have to change your address again.</p>
<p>The service I chose was <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>. Because I am a member of <a href="https://omg.lol">OMG.LOL</a>, I got a 10% discount off the price of a two-person account. Still, it's going to run us about $90 a year for full-service accounts that include email, contacts, calendars and document storage. Fastmail was able to import all the mail from my Gmail account, all 156,000 messages as well as my hundreds of contacts in less than two hours. It will also continue to import messages as long as the account is open, so I am not under the gun to get the transition done rushing. I will probably never close my Gmail account. I will just stop using it over time as I transition.</p>
<p>Most of us use our email addresses for two primary purposes. One is to get email, of course. The other use is as our username at the many, many websites that require one. I have 276 accounts where my Gmail address is also my account name, ranging from the American Automobile Association to Zoom. Many of these are critical, like my bank, my insurance company, my pension plan and others. Some are inconsequential — like Airbnb, where it doesn't really matter if I just start a new account. There isn't a shortcut to changing these accounts, according to the Internet. I know because I asked. I'm just going to have to slog through a few each day until I get it finished.</p>
<p>I got a free app from the Apple Store for iOS called <a href="https://unroll.me">Unroll.me</a> that allowed me to unsubscribe from a lot of the newsletters I receive without having to find an email from every one of them, find the link, click on it and go through the process manually. Instead of resubscribing to them using my new email address, I am going to use a feature of my RSS service, <a href="https://inoreader.com">Inoreader</a> that generates special email addresses that result in the newsletter being sent to them on my behalf. I can then read the newsletters using their app instead of receiving them in my email inbox. I can cut down on the email I get, while still keeping up with the newsletters I like.</p>
<p>I will also have to notify all of my contacts of my new email address. I'm already suffering a bit because I recently stopped using Facebook. I used Messenger quite a bit and there was no way to migrate or export those conversations. Now I am putting another potential stumbling block into staying in touch with some people. That's one of the unfortunate side effects of the process of getting away from the big tech companies. It is by design.</p>
<p>I am sure as this process moves along, I will learn more about how to better handle it. When I do, I will pass those tips along.<BR>

              <summary><p>Right now, in the year 2025 CE, it is relatively common to believe that if you are born with a penis, you are a man, and if you are born with a vagina, you are a woman. It is common to believe that anyone who attempts to assert otherwise is mentally ill at best.</p>
<p>At face value, when I put it that way free of any other context, reading it as a severed employee of Lumon Corporation might read it, it looks relatively reasonable.</p>
<p>But let's look at it another way: <strong>Why the fuck would you care what genitals someone else has?</strong></p>
<p>There's lots of talk about gender lately in the human world, and it's frankly getting exhausting. It's not likely that anyone who reads this will have <em>not</em> heard all the arguments, so I won't bother going over them. But I will say a little bit about my experience.</p>
<p>I never felt comfortable as a boy. As in, when I was a child, I was basically always uncomfortable, but also, the idea of &quot;boyhood&quot; never resonated with me. I have vague, distant memories of being a child wishing I was a girl. But those thoughts were socialized out of me. They were &quot;wrong.&quot; I was a boy, and that was that.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 25 years. I've got basically everything I thought I wanted. I've been extremely fortunate. I'm married with no kids and two cats. I'm doing quite well in my school where I'm changing careers. But <em>still</em> something isn't quite right. I've spent years feeling things weren't right, but I couldn't seem to find what it was killing me.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To make a long story just a tad shorter, I saw this meme.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/junebash/uzfqvsqj5eyb1.webp" alt="uzfqvsqj5eyb1" /></p>
<p>That was my egg-crack moment.</p>
<p>Then, I had some friends who convinced me that, if I wanted to be another gender, <em>I could just be another gender</em>. I started doing research on hormones and whatnot. But still it seemed scary.</p>
<p>Then, one night while I was bored at home alone between Christmas and New Year's Eve, I decided to download a pre-LLM AI face-changer app. My entire life, every time I looked in the mirror, it was... acceptable, at best. Seeing myself as a woman I realized just how little it took to make myself... hot. I say that half in jest, but truly, I finally saw a version of myself I could be happy seeing in the mirror.</p>
<p>I immediately realized I could no longer live like I had been. It wasn't even a choice. I had opened Pandora's box. Insert another cliche.</p>
<p>Fast forward another 4 years, and I am so much happier with who I am. I've gone through the tumultuous second puberty, the divorce (we're still friends!), figuring out makeup and bra sizes and realizing to a whole new extent how patriarchy affects both cis and trans women.</p>
<p><strong>Now, I just want to live my life.</strong> Like, I just want to go the grocery store, movie theater, travel, walk my dog, pet my cats, visit to an aquarium. Normal shit.</p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to live in a place where most people don't bat an eye at me anymore than any other person. In fact, I've been getting a flattering number of comments about my hair being beautiful lately. I'm very grateful!</p>
<p>However, that comfort comes at a price. No, literally, the cost of living in this town is starting to get ridiculous compared to more rural areas of the state, and especially to other states. But living in one of those other places comes with another cost: I'd be much more likely to run into folks that glare at me when I wear a dress, or worse, accost me when trying to use a bathroom for folks that match my general appearance. <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/">Transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated assault</a>. There are videos of <em>cis</em> folks trying to go to the bathroom and getting harassed by people thinking they're trans and asking to see their IDs.</p>
<p>If I hadn't been an ADHD procrastinating dummy, last year I could have gotten a passport that said I was a lady. Fortunately I have my license, but now with this stupid administration, I can't leave the country without outing myself, which can be a <em>major deal</em> in certain parts of the world.</p>
<p>Two of the times I've travelled by plane in the US since coming out, I've been groped by security and told that they detected something in my pants before I outed myself to them as transgender. Because I didn't do a good enough job tucking. Because they saw my license said I was a lady, and set their stupid machine to that setting, I'm guessing. Or maybe they wanted to humiliate me! Who knows.</p>
<p>The company I work for is based in Florida, where laws, although vague, potentially allow folks to assault me for trying to go to the &quot;wrong&quot; bathroom. Every time I use a gendered public restroom, I do a little speed-walk to the stall with my head down, and upon exiting, try to wash my hands as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I just want to shit in peace. I just want to travel without danger of being outed and potentially assaulted. I'm not demanding that I be allowed to do a strip dance or inject unwilling children or feminize anyone or put litter boxes in my schools (god that rumor was fucking stupid lol). I'm not trying to shove my identity in anyone's faces. <em>I just want to live my life.</em> And a lot of folks, for some reason, want to make that very difficult. I think that's fucked up.</p>

              <p><strong>Author</strong>: hidden (tiramisu)</p>
              <p><strong>Published</strong>: 2025-03-01 04:01:00 UTC</p>
            </hgroup>
            <details>
              <summary><p>I deleted WhatsApp today. It is the last of Meta’s products I use, and has proved the hardest to get rid of.</p>
<p>I first got the app to message new friends when I moved abroad; in South America, keeping in touch without it seemed impossible. I deleted it shortly after I came back. After moving to the city last year, I redownloaded it to communicate with my soccer teams and got one of my friend groups to move to it too. But as I watched Zuckerberg double-down on dragging Meta deeper into hell these past few months I have felt increasing levels of disgust every time I open the app.</p>
<p>(On a product note, while I admit WhatsApp is the least bad Meta product I’ve used, it’s getting worse all the time, and I’m sick of having AI forcefed to me at every opportunity. No, I don’t want to see Meta AI's loop spin ominously every time I send memes to my friends.)</p>
<p>Today I decided that I'd finally had enough. I’m not sure my resistance will last. J said it was rude that I didn’t inform the group chat, which stung. Is it? I‘d talked at length about my desire to leave the platform with no real response from anyone else, so I didn’t see any point in announcing it to the group. Be it confirmation bias or the ghosts of my childhood haunting me, I think my predilection for Irish goodbyes can be traced back to the sinking sense I feel that I’m a peripheral member in every friend group and that nobody would really notice or care if I were to disappear. My rational brain knows this to be untrue, but my heart doesn't feel the same way — do you understand?</p>
<p>I think where I am going with this is that I wish that I didn't have to choose between keeping in touch with my friends and making choices that align with my values. I cannot in good conscience stand by and continue to use the apps that enrich these billionaire oligarchs, but few of my friends care enough about these issues to even download Signal. In the end, nobody’s happy: both of my main friend groups (one on Facebook Messenger, another on WhatsApp) have Misu-sized holes in them, and I sit alone in self-imposed isolation. What good is privacy and security if you have no one to message?</p>
<p>One of the most common critiques I hear from others is that I'm difficult, a label I have no choice but to accept. I often make choices on my own at the drop of a hat, leaving other people to deal with the aftereffects. This WhatsApp group is a prime example — I moved the group to WhatsApp, then months later decided I didn't want to use the app anymore. My friends are understandably annoyed at me. In the past I told myself that if people didn't accommodate my choices they probably weren't my real friends to begin with, but it's becoming patently clear to me that this isn't the case: people <em>do</em> care about me, and them not sharing my values doesn't change that. I just wish there were a better way, even as I know it wouldn't be called sacrifice if you didn't have to give anything up.</p>
<hr />
<p><small><em>If you have any thoughts, please <a href="tab:/contact/">let me know</a>, as I've been feeling low about this.

              <summary><p>March really has it out for my family.</p>
<p>My spouse died in March. His brother died in March, almost exactly one year later. And today, I got a text message informing me that our aunt Julie died this morning.</p>
<p>Julie was a rabble-rousing leftist who was too old to give a single shit what anyone thought of her. In her younger days, she co-founded a union, which is still active in my hometown.</p>
<p>As her health declined, she was Extremely Online, which meant that in her later years she occasionally said ignorant things. But I've never met anyone quicker to change their opinion when presented with facts, nor quicker to admit when they'd said something out of ignorance. May we all be more like her.</p>
<p>Julie loved Snoopy and cats. She knitted the world's best washcloths. I sincerely hope she left the pattern to someone, and I hope that someone will be generous enough to share it with me.</p>
<p>I'm going to miss her. A lot.</p>

<hr />
<p>When life passes you the ball out of nowhere, hell, just run with it. I've had many romantic stories and heard many romantic stories from good friends and fellow travelers in my little life. I would say that my existence is a genuinely wholesome product that stemmed from a travel romance, so I would say that I'm just a little biased.</p>
<p>I liked that my parents met at the beach. My dad was just a young traveler and my mom was with her university friends on a girls' trip. One of the romantic advice that my dad told me was, &quot;sometimes you just have to say yes to a group of pretty girls, your mom was the one to invite me by the way, and then you just be polite and open-minded and respectful and just see what happens.&quot; My father is quite wholesome, but I'm not sure what went down and how they kept in touch (during the 90's)! I don't need all the finer details of course. To me, it's just so romantic and adventurous.</p>
<p>I've been trying to search for every nook and cranny for some semblance of amorous and whimsy like that. I've been protecting my heart quite a bit as of late. I think I just need to let loose a little bit. I usually am hesitant when I get along with someone really well, especially when they're a bit transient. I always seem to end up in silly situations and hastily try make goodbyes a lot less sad (for me. I don't know about the other person, in my experience, they usually don't really give a shit, unfortunately). I don't know man. Sometimes people just might surprise you.</p>
<hr />
<p>So my most recent date I went on - he was lovely. I was a little bit on a tear actually. I definitely out-Kayla'd myself on our first date (during our 2nd one, I was a lot cooler... maybe.). I felt that I was &quot;way too myself&quot; (overshared quite a bit, but so did he, in my defense.) The reasoning behind this silly little phenomenon of &quot;lore-dropping too much&quot; on the first date is due to several factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>We're both attractive foreigners with a good sense of humor (I don't want to toot my horn too much, but my sparring partner could keep up with me and I enjoyed that so much);</li>
<li>I took him to several swanky cool bars that I liked and alcohol was flowin' (but crazy enough, we did not drink that much. I had a really big carby meal and only had a beer and a cocktail! I swear, you guys!);</li>
<li>We both have that face that &quot;you can tell anything to&quot;. I feel like we're independently safe spaces for people to spill their guts to, and in turn, that made us more open and freely sharing anything and everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps the guy was looking for something fun and refreshing (as am I, always and forever) and it was one of the most fun first dates that I had in a long time (I've had a lot of fun first dates as well!). It's the shared language I guess, both linguistically and humoristically. Dating people who don't share the same native language as you is a challenge, but I don't mind it at all. Culture-wise, however, we are a little different.</p>
<p>He's a Northerner... Midlands... person? He met me at a cute coffee shop, with shitty food and equally as shitty coffee. As an <em>uncultured</em> American swine, of course I'm not quite sure the geography of the UK all too well. Also, all of my sad British friends are from the South! I like my friends, of course. They're reasonable and good people. However, I've met a lot of Southern folk around SE Asia, and they aren't the creme de la creme of Britain, in fact I hate some of them. I sometimes hate to see some lads on tour. Menaces, a majority of them. Some are genuinely sound people, but I've came across some ridiculous ones that can't even hold their liquor. A disgrace to Britain.</p>
<p>For northerners, I have had no exposure whatsoever except for a penpal from Middlesbrough that I had when I was 16. He told me to listen to a bunch of Oasis and alt-J songs (I appreciated this culture exchange, of course) and thought that I was good company. How I met my penpal- we played this trivia game together called QuizUp and we kept matching up in geography question matches. After like 30 games consecutively over a course of week of nonstop playing, we exchanged WhatsApp contact info and it was cool. I'm literally trying to reconnect with him as we speak. I need intel lol.</p>
<p>I looked at several maps of the U.K. North and South divide (shown below). I am starting to get a better picture of the &quot;vibe&quot; of certain folks there. As of this moment, I, for one, prefer Northerners to Southerners (sorry in advanced). I might have a biased standpoint in this, of course. I've only really ever been to London. I must write about my trip to the capitol, but I'm putting all these little stories on the backburner because I have to sort a lot of things :)</p>

<p>Anyway, when I was in London, the only strangers that I had a genuinely lovely time talking to were random Northerners that talked to me on the tube. No one ever talks to you on the tube- that was a statement that was thrown around too often around my Southern friends. People just approached me and had a conversation with me on the metro and I found it so startling (but genuinely heartwarming). The people that talked to me were <em>all from the North.</em></p>
<p>A middle-aged guy from Liverpool talked to me for half an hour about his recent trip to Thailand and then he told me he found me pretty (lol). A frantic, but really nice lady from Hertfortshire (she said her family's a little bit closer to Bedford-Cambridge-ish area and up further north so I'm like... <em>&quot;so...you're not a Londoner, right?</em> and she was like <em>&quot;Oh god, no. That'd be horrid if I were. I just commute back and forth.&quot;</em> ), she had a conversation with me on the train and I was a little bit lost, but fumbled about on Google Maps. This woman literally walked with me, guided me to my stop, and waited with me for a little bit before she caught her train out of the city centre. I was so impressed and very grateful. I literally got a taste of Northern hospitality in one of the most heartless, yet culturally-vibrant, UK cities imaginable. What a genuinely good collective of people.</p>
<p>It seems like I'm bashing the southern Brits a lot, but I don't know man. I got a bitter taste in my mouth. My thoughts are summarized in this Reddit comment:</p>

<p>Another thing I'd like to mention is that a lot of life is just improvisation. I really enjoyed reading this <a href="tab:https://medium.com/@a.fab.journey/how-to-deal-with-travel-romances-9947f09b5c05">Medium article</a> by Fabienne Fong Yan. Deals with a lot of the things I face when it comes to stuff like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So far for one bitter end. That’s when you start wondering: what just happened? Did I make the wrong decision? Why did we even talk about meeting again? Didn’t it mean anything to each other? Did he lie to me? Was I a complete fool? What am I even doing here?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is: life happened. Love happened. And travel happened. The connection did exist and we’d loved each other, in the broad sense of the term. But timing was right only for… a travel romance!&quot;</p>

<em>Me updating my friends again</em></p>
<p>Dating is fun. Finding out what you like and don't like- it's supposed to be fun and not mind-numbingly sucky like how some people make it out to be. Dating sucks because the people suck, ok? Sometimes you just have to filter out the bad apples until you find a good egg. Yeah, it's terrible when people are bad communicators. When I'm out and about and hurt from a stupid lover, I can heal. One of the best advice I've received is that if you're in a social situation and it's kinda dead air and bleak, &quot;if it's not fun, you make it fun.&quot; and I've taken that advice to heart in everything that I do now.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I'd say that my ideal relationship is having banter similar to the <a href="tab:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5FyP9rtHI">parents from the movie Easy A (2010)</a>. Not going to lie, I want Stanley Tucci, but not bald. Sorry. I'm racist against bald people (for legal reasons, this is a joke).</p>
<hr />
<p>So essentially- I just had a small taste of something delightfully British. Take me to a bloody pub and give me a <strong>warm</strong> meat pie (I had a very terrible and cold pie, about a 1/4 slice, in London and I will never forget it, it was £6- I was livid.). Take me to a Premier League footy match, I will be so tuned in and do all the chants and shit omg. Take me to the middle of a messy bog filled with drugged-up youngsters, pitch a tent with me, watch me go apeshit in a live music festival. Take me to a Sunday roast dinner, I would love to literally eat an entire Thanksgiving spread with friends and family I enjoy.</p>
<p>I have not much to say on the personal side of things. I really want to keep things to myself and my circle of friends. However, what I can say is that it felt like a wonderful fever dream. The level of comfort was astounding for a first date. There was no judgment that passed between the two of us and if there were a comment so absurd and odd (not like, insane though, heh), then it's met with genuine intrigue, rather than strangeness.</p>
<p>A part of me is telling me to just roll the dice and go if they're showing enough interest and you see potential. You literally only live once. Another part of me is just to hunker down and just stay put. I should just let this one pass. I shouldn't get too involved too quickly. He told me it takes a while for him to be emotionally invested (I am the same way, but I like to see the good parts of people more often and way too quickly). I'm just here, vibing. I'd say I'm a pretty consistent friend, to say the least.</p>
<p>So goddamn refreshing. Like I said, we'll see what happens. Honestly, I was on a bit of a tear lately. The best way to come down from a series of high, uplifting moments (I've been going out with friends, meeting new people, having a lot of fun) is to have a completely heart-wrenching cinematic romance rendezvous with some vaguely Mediterranean-Latino-Arab looking Brit and have a bit of a laugh. My heart hurts a bit, but a good hurt- like similar to the pain that suffering artists experience. It really helps them make one of the most poignant masterpieces they've ever made. I feel like I'm writing pretty well today :)</p>
<hr />
<p>But I'm just vibing, who really knows what will happen? He really was like, &quot;Don't worry I won't ghost you.&quot; and &quot;At the very least, we could be really good friends.&quot; and &quot;Oh I'd like to call you, every week or so if time is willing!&quot; Okay, yeah buddy. I'll believe these statements when I see some action.</p>
<p>Wow, I simply could just be the biggest idiot on the planet and was just played by yet another stupid man. He's out and about and I know the vibe of what's going to happen if things go awry. Maybe I just made this random dude's night, and honestly that's fine with me.</p>
<p>Or we could just see how things unfold. I'm trying not to be too cynical these days. We're so conditioned to be bleak and melancholic due to the state of the world. I wish that we could have some fun and just be happy that things turned out well. I'm genuinely happy this happened to me.</p>
<hr />
<p>~ you're alright,</p>

              <summary><p>When it comes to learning a new skill such as how to drive a car, playing a sport, or an academic discipline, there is a unique relationship between a person’s confidence and their level of competence at different points of the journey. A popular depiction of this relationship is the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect is the cognitive bias that leads you or me to overestimate our abilities too early on the learning journey.</p>
<p>There are five stages of the Dunning-Kruger Effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowing nothing</li>
<li>Mount Stupid</li>
<li>The Valley of Despair</li>
<li>Slope of Enlightenment</li>
<li>Plateau of Sustainability.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="ZHpohks"><a href="https://imgur.com/ZHpohks">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Stage one: Knowing nothing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this stage you have no prerequisite knowledge on the area of study or skill. When you begin learning, the initial progress seems fast and smooth. While building fundamental knowledge and experiencing early meetings with success, you grow confident in your abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a child, I had a growing curiosity for numbers, making math the easiest subject for me to keep up with in school. I was highly confident in my ability to solve math problems and it felt great.</p>
<p>My earliest memory of loving math comes from a 1st-grade classroom game. The class was divided into two groups, each standing on opposite sides of the room. We then formed two lines facing each other in the center, where our teacher stood with a stack of flashcards.</p>
<p>She would call up the two students at the front of each line and read out a math problem. The first to answer correctly moved to the back of the line, while the other sat down, eliminated. This continued until only two students remained, and the winner of their final matchup was crowned the class champion.</p>
<p>I won the first time we played this game - then the second, third and fourth time. At barely six years old, felt extremely excited about math, and quickly fell in love with the subject. It was fun and easy!</p>
<h2>Stage two: Mount Stupid</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As you get closer and closer to the peak of this stage, your confidence in your abilities turns into arrogance, thinking you know much more than you do. At this point, many people feel that they won’t experience any future difficulties in their learning journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn’t realised it then, but up until 13 years old, I found myself grovelling my way up Mount Stupid and by 16, scraped up by setbacks and harsh lessons, I guess I managed to reach the summit.</p>
<p>Before the mount, Math continued feeling fun and easy throughout my early days of school. From dominating classroom math competitions, consistent good grades in elementary school, to getting a 96th percentile score on state standardized tests and qualifying for Algebra as an incoming 8th grader in middle school - Math was easy. It almost felt like I didn’t need to work as hard and over time, I began to steadily develop a sense of overconfidence, if not outright arrogance in my skills.</p>
<p>Since it took me little to no effort to learn math concepts, I started to get complacent. I stopped double checking all my answers on worksheets, quizzes, and tests. I was always able to bounce back and finish with high grades though, because I’d put in the most effort drilling practice problems for tests. In hindsight, all this did was make me think that my natural ability at math would always outweigh my bad habits.</p>
<p>My teachers had the same script for my parents every time: “Mike is one of the brightest kids in the room, and could be the best, but he distracts himself by talking too much and forgets to double check his work.”</p>
<h2>Stage three: The Valley of Despair</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This stage is where reality hits hard. In your continued efforts to learn you encounter complexities, exceptions, and deeper layers of difficulty. Failure becomes commonplace and one feels stuck or overwhelmed because you realize how much you don’t know. Confidence has dropped drastically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first got into high school, my math goal was to take calculus as a senior. I didn’t even know what I would do with calculus, but I just wanted to reach that level. The last class I needed was precalculus, which I took as a junior.</p>
<p>Early on into the year, things were comfortably challenging and I made through the first quarter with no problems. But come the second quarter, trigonometry was introduced and I struggled heavily. Geometry already made little sense to me, trigonometry even less so. By the time the first half of the year ended, I wasn’t sure if I could even finish the class with a C when I got a 70 on my midterm exam.</p>
<p>Things only got worse in the third quarter. My bad habits amplified the learning gaps I was failing to close, taking a toll on me. I couldn’t even get through homework problems without wanting to throw my textbook out my bedroom window. I couldn’t grasp it. For the first time in my life, I couldn’t understand anything. Numbers were companions in my world and Math was the language we spoke. Yet for the first time, there was this barrier I couldn’t overcome.</p>
<p>By my 17th birthday, with just two months left in my junior year of high school, I felt the sharp plummet towards the Valley of Despair. Homework assignments bruised my ego with scores of 65 to 75 points. Math quizzes followed suit and right hooked me with Cs and Ds. I failed one major unit test that left me battered before the final exams came around.</p>
<p>My high school math dreams were crushed when I failed my precalculus final exam during the last week of the school year, which meant not making it to calculus as a senior. It was demoralizing. I never in my life thought my worst performance in school would be Math related, but that’s how my junior year ended.</p>
<p>​​The fall was brutal.</p>
<p>I began to develop a bitterness towards math. I signed up for a statistics class for my senior year, mainly because I didn’t want to take the alternative, which was environmental science.</p>
<p>After the first quarter, I barely put any effort into learning. Since it was my last class of the day, I often drifted through lessons and practiced problems without much focus.</p>
<p>Half the time, I lazily completed my work; the other half, I chatted with classmates, played emulator games on my phone, or took naps. I ended up with a B—more out of my teacher’s pity than my own effort. I told myself I didn’t care about math anymore.</p>
<h2>Stage four: The Slope of Enlightenment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Persistence is the key to arriving at stage 4, as the extreme lows of stage push some people to quit. Upon upwards climb from the lows, true competence is developed because you’re equipped with real experience and a structured approach to learning. As knowledge deepens in this stage, confidence rises once more, this time at a steady and realistic pace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost two years into college, my advisor randomly asked me about taking Calculus as an elective. I looked up from my phone surprised. My major wasn’t even in math.</p>
<p>When I asked why he suggested that, he said, “You look like a guy that’s good with numbers.” I gave a short chuckle and said I would think about it. I walked away from that meeting wondering why I gave up in high school. Thoughts of what I could possibly do if I tried again with math periodically popped up in my mind for the next six months.</p>
<p>I finally gave in and spun the pie - I missed how my world felt when I was in the zone solving math problems.</p>
<p>Two years after graduating high school, I attempted to self-teach math from series and tutorials on YouTube, to platforms like Khan Academy. The goal was to review previously learned concepts while introducing new ones but I kept hitting a mental block that I just couldn’t push through.</p>
<p>While I was rebooting my connection with math, I had also finished college a year early. This meant spending lots of time back at home job hunting and doing math problems periodically to distract my mind from the daunting exhaustion of being unemployed.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://mikelikejordan.bearblog.dev/middle-school-teacher-pivot-to-ai-and-ml/">Following my mother’s suggestion, I decided to look for a job as a teacher, and in the fall of 2019, I was teaching 7th grade students Math alongside my mentor teacher.</a></p>
<p>Being a teacher came with its baggage, but breaking down math concepts to children and helping them overcome their challenges with learning new topics felt very rewarding. Teaching unearthed a fire in me that I hadn’t felt in a long time. The classroom became a world I could understand again, my lesson plans, a language I could craft and my students, companions who motivated me to deliver and inspire. I had found my groove of being great at something again and this time, I had a purpose beyond me. I was in my zone of enlightenment for many years as a teacher and I was really good at it.</p>
<p>However, this comfort zone eventually morphed into internal restlessness. I realized that unless I pushed myself to overcome the failures I experienced a decade ago I would never forgive myself. I decided to attempt another reboot of my connection with math again and in July 2024, I stumbled upon Math Academy while scrolling on X. After reading some tweets of people raving about the site, I decided to sign up.</p>
<h2>What is Math Academy?</h2>
<p><a href="tab:https://www.mathacademy.com/">Math Academy</a> is an online learning platform designed to teach mathematics in a highly efficient and structured way. It uses an AI-powered adaptive learning system that customizes your learning plan to your current skill level.</p>
<p>After you take a diagnostic test for the math course of your choice, the personalized learning path is laid out, showing you unlocked lessons and letting you know what percentage of the course is currently completed. Practicing math becomes very easy, you simply show up to math academy every day in front of your screen and work on the unlocked sub-topics, akin to one walking into a gym and all the exercise equipment is laid out for you, ready to be used.</p>
<p>You’re consistently challenged, but not overwhelmed and the lessons are designed to help students learn in the shortest amount of time possible, making it possible to reach mastery at a quicker rate than traditional school instruction.</p>
<p>I was blown away by how I would spend hours almost every day practicing math. Despite all the bruises and cuts my ego had built up from previous attempts I began my climb out of The Valley of Despair. Problem by problem, lesson by lesson, I took one step at a time from the lows, constantly faced with thoughts of, “What if I failed again?” But the thought, “What if you don’t this time?” pushed me to keep on going.</p>
<h2>Stage five: The plateau of sustainability</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In this 5th and final stage, you’ve reached an expert level of mastery in your area of study, having now acquired high skills and legitimate confidence. There is an understanding that learning never stops, and because of this, you have enthusiasm to keep on learning, knowing that growth will continue with consistency and stability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m proud to say that From July 2024 till today, I have completed the Integrated Math Honors series (I, II and III) and currently 63 percent complete Mathematical Foundations 3.</p>
<p>Everything I learned in my high school math classes, along with more topics I never got exposure to were taught in IMH II and III. When I finally completed III, I made it across the other side of the tunnel. I finally was capable of learning calculus, and I succeeded in surpassing my previous peak set almost 11 years ago.</p>
<p><a href="tab:https://mikelikejordan.bearblog.dev/python-to-machine-learning-upskilling-from-scratch/">I enjoyed teaching, but numbers were childhood companions in my world and Math was the language we spoke. Math academy inspired me to commit to a new found goal of transitioning from education to machine learning with the tech industry. I knew at this point that the next step in my career had to involve stretching my math with endless possibilities and problem solving.</a></p>
<p>I still experience challenges everyday with Mathematical Foundations 3, but that’s par for the course. Learning math as an adult is an entirely different thing than as a kid. After being humbled during my high school years, I’m more patient and structured in my learning. I have a direct pathway towards the success I want to reach.</p>
<p>Today I know that I always had what it took to be great at math, I just didn’t know what prerequisites I was lacking. I have MathAcademy to thank for this enlightenment and my current skill set and ability as evidence.</p>
<p>There will always be waves of uncertainty, but embracing the discomfort with confidence and commitment to win will always pay off in the end. Approach learning with relentless curiosity and practice, until you understand and can move on to the next topic.</p>
<p>As I continue my climb up the slope of enlightenment, I hope my story is your sign to reboot your passion, give it another go, keep trying and never stop learning. Math Academy was my sign - what will yours be?</p>
<p>Here’s to being a preserving student for life.</p>

              <summary><p>I've been meaning to write a movie review, and a friend of mine recently reminded me of <em>Star Wars</em>, which has been my favourite movie franchise for quite some time now.</p>
<p><strong>Minor spoilers ahead</strong></p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<h4>A New Hope</h4>

<hr />
<h4>Story</h4>

<p>It's easy to write <em>A New Hope</em> off as just another &quot;hero's journey&quot;. The story we follow in this movie is, in itself, pretty straightforward: Darth Vader, the right-hand man of the Empire and main villain, kidnaps Princess Leia Organa, the leader of the rebels, in order to retrieve the plans for the Death Star and regain control over the galaxy. A farm boy named Luke Skywalker, who has little to no idea what he's doing, gets pulled into the chaos and embarks on a quest to rescue her with the help of his friends. Of course, good triumphs over evil, and we get a happy ending. Everyone claps.</p>
<p>Beyond all the lightheartedness lies a rather dark story, though. As the movie unfolds, we catch glimpses of a larger history - the remnants of the Jedi, the rise of the Sith, and a war that's been raging long before we arrived. Nothing is overexplained, yet every detail, such as the worn-down technology, the political tension between the Empire and the Rebels, and the mystical power of the Force, suggests that a deeper mythology is waiting to be uncovered.</p>
<p>Originally, <em>A New Hope</em> was meant to be a standalone film, but it raised enough questions that a continuation was practically inevitable. What really happened during the Clone Wars that Ben Kenobi mentions so briefly? What was life like during the High Republic era? What happened to Luke's father? To this day, we're still getting more answers with each new addition to the franchise.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Cinematography</h4>

<p>The visuals are <strong>stunning</strong>. Practical effects and a high budget can go a long way, and the techniques the filmmakers used to make this space setting feel real are very clever. Instead of today's digital landscapes, they built miniatures and used motion-control photography to bring the galaxy to life. The Star Destroyers, X-Wings, and Millennium Falcon weren't computer-generated. They were physical, hand-built models, detailed down to the smallest components.</p>
<p>For planets, they used matte paintings. Even the Death Star's interior is largely made up of paintings, but the way it was filmed creates such as convincing illusion that it feels completely real.</p>
<p>Obviously, not every scene is flawless, and there are moments where the effects can look a little rough around the edges, but mind you, this film is over fifty years old. If anything, the imperfections only add an endearing charm that speaks to the passion of its creators. As someone who's a sucker for good cinematography, the level of artistry the original trilogy brings to the table is next-level.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Final Notes</h4>

<p>For all its worth, <em>A New Hope</em> is not only the start to an unforgettable journey that packs an incredible amount of content into just two hours, but it's also endlessly charming.</p>
<p>The real beauty of the franchise, for me, has always been in its inherent weirdness. The cantina scenes on Tatooine, where aliens of all shapes and sizes drink, gamble, and argue; the Jawas, with their robed figures and eerie chants; and the droids, R2-D2 and C-3Po, who are the first characters we're introduced to and serve as the heart and soul of the movie's comedy. There's just nothing else like it. The strange juxtaposition of high-stakes adventure with these quirky and completely unique details is what makes the <em>Star Wars</em> movies stand out as such original and compelling films.</p>
<p>For all the reasons listed above, <em>A New Hope</em> stands as the third-best entry in the Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p><strong>Score: ★★★★ ½ (Amazing)</strong></p>

              <summary><p>I was going to write a short post about how I'm not normal about upvotes, but <a href="https://mantis.bearblog.dev/202503061100/">mantis beat me to it</a>. They nailed a lot of the same points I was going to, including a link to <a href="https://blog.parallax.fyi/small-tip-replacing-the-upvote-text-on-bearblog/">the post that taught me how to remove the number of upvotes</a> from my blog posts.</p>
<p>For most of my posting career here at bearblog, I declined to include my posts on the discover feed. During my most prolific bout of posting, I would only turn discovery on for my Sunday links posts, just as sort of a reminder that I'm still here. If I left upvotes enabled on the posts I was actually proud of, I would get locked in a sick loop of checking for validation and self-doubt. If I posted something I thought was good but didn't get any upvotes, I'd start to question all of my life choices and abilities; which the logical part of my brain knows is ridiculous. There are a million reasons a post might not get many or any upvotes. Maybe I posted it at a time not many people were looking at the discover feed. Maybe it was a subject not many people are interested in.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Maybe a small percentage of people who read think to actually click the button. I know it's not a true measurement of my ability or value as a person, but when you have CPTSD, anxiety and historical self-esteem issues, your brain tunes all these logical possibilities and focuses on the ones that mean there's a problem with me. Blogging was meant to be my escape from social media, where this constant validation dance is all-encompassing, so for the most part I simply opted out.</p>
<p>I knew it must be possible to hide the number of upvotes with CSS, but there was another problem: I could see my own posts and the number of upvotes they get on the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/?newest=true">discover feed</a>. Hiding the number of upvotes on the blog page would just mean I'd have to constantly refresh that page instead of the page with the post.</p>
<p>Well, the discovery page now has the ability to filter out posts by account. I don't know when this was added, but I think it must've been during my hiatus, because I don't remember it being there. This is a great feature which makes the discovery page usable, because I can filter out the spam, genAI slop, posts by people who forget to set their posting language, and people who write blogs where every sentence is given its own paragraph. And, of course, I can filter myself out. I added myself to the list of blogs I would like hidden from the feed, and now I'm free. The button is still there, and if you like my post, it would still mean a lot to me if you clicked it! It would mean other people have a chance to see my stuff, and that's awesome. But I'm no longer beholden to the number. I don't have to worry about my dumb brain desperately refreshing the page to see if the number has gone from 1 to 2. I no longer get irrationally depressed if the number stays at 1, because I can't see that it is.</p>
<p>I think, maybe, but I don't know, but I'm starting to feel like I got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S0EsOvpPqc">brain problem situation</a> on my hands 🦝</p>

              <summary><p>Today, I awoke to the first scent of spring slipping through the open window and a message from an old friend on my phone.</p>
<p>I will call her D. (If D reads this somehow: I'm sorry, but you know I'm like this. This is <em>a</em> version, but not <em>the</em> version. I am leaving many things in the drawer.)</p>
<p>I met D seven years ago. It was July, on high ground overlooking a valley, many thousands of miles from where I grew up. I was 17. I wanted to touch the electric spirit of humanity. I wanted to store up the world, but first I wanted to know it. The year prior, I had finally found my stride as a young short filmmaker, starting to play at student film festivals and to make things that I considered beautiful. I desired the beautiful, but I was fundamentally skeptical of it, as I felt that it was the condition of young womanhood to be allured by and barred from the elite circle of <em>beauty</em>. I established mantras meant to cure me of this unworthiness. I made films about &quot;being a young woman&quot; and I was fixated on the ethics of portraying femininity in the image when the image was what imprisoned femininity. A paradox that I tried to solve through film, and that I have since ceased trying to solve. But through all of it, I experienced and synthesized life in teenage poetry. Ambitious, as always.</p>
<p>I found this in a notebook from that time, that July, far away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So maybe it is here that I will announce myself to the world. No one here to question but myself.
<em>All exploration to be taken as fact.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had suspicions – as did many of my close friends – that I might be Queer. It's strange what we take as signs of Queerness, even when I am explaining my 17-year-old self now. &quot;I had a septum ring and a buzzcut,&quot; I sometimes say, &quot;of course I was Queer.&quot; Obviously that has nothing to do with it. Obviously.</p>
<p>So, D and I. D was beautiful. I have both sharpened and flattened the story of us over many years, so now I am hesitant to tell it. I will say that we held hands and lay under a billion stars. I will say that I remember the back of her head well; I remember looking at her dark curls and knowing I had to say something I did not know how to formulate. I will say that we talked around and around the truth of the situation and could not bear to say it. And we said goodbye, and &quot;I love you,&quot; which could have meant terribly different things but I think meant the same thing, and we separated – because it was coincidental, all of it, and the session was over. We had to return home.</p>
<p>Although I'd hoped we could stay in touch, that I could keep her presence virtually with me through messages and video calls, that maybe I could express to her – as I'd already tried – that I loved her, D wanted something else. It was too painful for her. She disappeared and did not say good-bye.</p>
<p>4 years ago, I finally asked why. I demanded, actually. She explained, kind of, but she could still not face it and disappeared again. Her phone number changed.</p>
<p>Last week, I told this story to my friend Carleen (hi Carleen!) after a long time of leaving it to rest. Every few months over the last years, I have paused to measure the distance between then and now. <em>Then</em> gets farther and farther away. Maybe it's because I've just settled again and am looking down the barrel at my mid-twenties that the estrangement from her memory gained a sudden new meaning. I thought, I am waiting on D but I no longer know her, and so it feels wrong to remember only the old D. It is so <em>strange</em>. &quot;Not before known, heard, or seen&quot;. She is strange.</p>
<p>But, what if I tried one more time to find her? I've tried a few times over the years, and mostly come up with nothing. (I'm such a stalker! I wonder if she's stalked me the same way. If she has, she would have certainly found this blog.)</p>
<p>So, I tried and I found something different this time. I found her. D is no longer across an ocean. She's much much closer. <em>Fuck it,</em> I thought and drafted a message. It even required me to start a free trial on LinkedIn (the lengths one must go to for modern love!). That was going to be my last attempt. It was going to be the final test, and after the silence I would finally give our story up and I would let D go. But this morning, she responded.</p>
<p>By the time I see her again, hug her, look at her, sit down with her, maybe cry with her, it will be just barely 7 years exactly from when we first met.</p>
<p>What is it about sevens?</p>
<p>A lucky number. The most combinations with numbers under 10 (good for Craps). The day of rest. The only prime number preceding a cube. Seven seas, seven heavens, seven virtues, seven sins. Seven continents.</p>
<p>The odd number that feels even. The odd number that feels right.</p>
<p><em>P.S. If you're wondering more about the feeling of our story, and the way it felt at 17, you can watch <a href="tab:https://vimeo.com/336815850">the short film</a> I made about it at the time. I will say, it's not an accurate rendition exactly, and it has a few cringey poetic moments, but it is, for the most part, honest.</em></p>

              <summary><p>Like a lot of people, I've been almost surgically grafted to my smartphone for years. But in the last two months, my habits have changed so much that this may be the beginning of the end of that relationship.</p>
<p>Since taking the library job, I've rediscovered my preference for print books - and now that I have access to over six million titles through the state's interlibrary loan system, I just don't need to download stuff and read it on my phone the way I once did.</p>
<p>Some of my work documents are still digital-only. I review for Booklist, among other things, and they only send digital galleys these days. But those are PDFs, and I have yet to find anything that makes reading PDFs on a phone a not-annoying experience. So I don't read those on my phone anyway.</p>
<p>Since ditching social media, my attention span has grown back - and it continues to improve. I went from barely surviving 1,500-word articles to actually enjoying 15,000-word articles. Ten or twenty pages of the World Book Encyclopedia now go by without my even noticing (the limiting factor is now the arthritis in my hands rather than my attention span). I can watch entire television shows again without jonesing for The Scroll. It's great.</p>
<p>Since rearranging my online life, I'm writing far more than I ever did before. We're talking an extra 3,000 words a day on average on top of the stuff I write for clients. Typing that much on a phone is a no-go; I want my keyboard.</p>
<p>Similarly, making new webpages or updating my existing ones isn't a thing I can comfortably do on my phone. I could make a text document, I guess, but again - I don't want to type that much with my thumbs. Also, when I want to put a lot of links on a page, I don't want to go back and forth between browser and document on a phone. I want to put them side by side on my proper computer screen(s).</p>
<p>And since leaving the &quot;five websites each sharing screenshots of the other four,&quot; I'm doing a lot more stuff online that isn't optimized for phone - or even possible on phone. A lot of the best websites-as-art are nigh unreadable on mobile, for instance. When I'm exploring Neocities or Marginalia for ideas, my phone is not the place for it.</p>
<p>I also recently made a Gemini capsule. Today I learned how to use Lynx to browse the Web from the terminal in Linux. Lynx strips out everything but text, which makes some pages not usable. But Lynx also guarantees zero tracking, since it doesn't even recognize trackers as loadable. So I can read all I want without anyone collecting that data.</p>
<p>I can't use LaGrange (my Gemini browser) or Lynx from my phone at all, though. I have to do both on my home computer.</p>
<p>I do still use my phone for a few essentials, like cashing checks and texting with friends and family. It's still in hand every time I travel. Some things about it are still the most convenient or only way to do things - like handle bus fare.</p>
<p>And I'll always need a Microsoft Authenticator-equipped smartphone for work (gag). Though I did learn the other day that Authenticator will still work even if the phone has no SIM card, as long as the phone has an Internet connection. (A fun fact in case you're trying to put some distance between your Authenticator device and your daily driver phone.)</p>
<p>I've spent years hating how much time I spend on my phone, yet unable to put it down. I have a lot of hope that this may indeed be the beginning of that end.</p>

              <summary><p>If you're like me, you've worn glasses for a large percentage of your life but were never taught how to properly clean them. I've used disposable alcohol-based lens wipes, I've breathed on them and wiped them with a tissue (or my shirt), I've used those little microfiber cloths until they gained sentience, and none of it really does the job beyond a level I'll call &quot;tolerable&quot;. My spouse has shared with me the secrets of proper spectacle care, and I thought I'd pass the information on to anyone else who struggles with lens maintenance.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn on the warm water and give the lenses a rinse.</strong> This is to wash away any dust, eyelashes, dandruff or other debris that might scratch the lenses, and to make step 2 easier.</li>
<li><strong>Put a drop of dish soap on each side of both lenses.</strong> The water from step 1 should help the soap adhere to the lenses as you turn them over.</li>
<li><strong>Rub the lenses between your thumb and finger.</strong> Spread the soap over as much of the lens surface as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Rinse the lenses thoroughly.</strong> Continue using warm water, as switching to cool water at this stage can cause fogging. Rinse until you don't see any suds or a colorful soap sheen; all that should remain is droplets of water.</li>
<li><strong>Pat the lenses dry</strong> using a soft clean cloth. Microfiber works best for this purpose. You don't want to wipe them, as this can cause unpleasant streaking (and may cause scratching if an insufficiently soft cloth is used.) Just gently pat the lenses until all the water droplets are gone.</li>
<li><strong>Wipe away any water that got onto the frames.</strong> If you don't need to wear them immediately, you can also leave them to air dry.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Put your glasses on and see with perfect clarity for the first time since they were brand new. Repeat every few days as needed. Thanks again to Izzy for teaching me this technique without making me feel gross or dumb. Sometimes we can't see what we're always looking at 🦝</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong></em> thanks to Pixel for mentioning that dish soap may damage some protective films or special coatings (e.g. for antireflectivity.) If your lenses have this, check the care instructions for recommended cleaning options.</p>

              <summary><p>I realize I'm a little late, but I found the recent controversy surrounding a statement made by Andy Yen, the CEO of Proton, in support of Trump's nomination for antitrust to be very interesting. Although I think there are bigger problems to solve right now, I'm not going to pretend like I read closely into it or try to be politically correct here. If someone wants to stop using Proton's services, then all power to them. It's not up to me to decide whom you trust or do not trust.</p>
<p>Proton has obviously made a name for itself and is a favorite email provider among privacy enthusiasts. It also offers encrypted photo storage, a VPN, and calendar, and it seems like Proton Drive could genuinely rival Google Drive. Honestly, just reading about all those things makes me want to become a customer. So, I can see why it can be hard for those to leave who want to. Not to mention that migrating everything you have stored to a privacy-preserving alternative, which may even turn out to be multiple services and not an all-in-one solution, sounds like a headache. I don't want to downplay that.</p>
<p>But the reality is that it's possible, now more than ever before. You don't have to use Proton to preserve your digital privacy and still receive and send emails, and I hope more people realize that. Even though I don't work in data protection or anything like this, I've managed to learn about some of the various options and figure out a setup that works for me. For now this doesn't include Proton. I know I'm not the only one.</p>
<p>Of course there are downsides to every service. Nothing is perfect. Maybe one provider doesn't offer custom domains, or it's based in one of the fourteen eyes and that's not acceptable to you. Maybe it offers all the privacy features you want or need, but it's clunky and unpleasant to use.</p>
<p>As for me, though I am unfortunately stuck in the Outlook bubble for my job, I opt to use my Posteo email whenever possible. I've been a customer for years now and am pleased with it. There are several other candidates besides Proton like Mailbox.org or Tutanota that I may consider in the future.</p>
<p>Sure, Proton will probably still be preferred by the majority. Potentially condoning Trump is never a good sign, but I can't say Proton is good or bad. I more want to say that it's awesome we even have a choice between these things (somewhat). I'm not much of an optimist, and again, I don't want to underestimate the threats to a fair and privacy-respecting web. But the demand for privacy-respecting tools is only growing, or so it seems. There is a plethora of privacy tools and resources to find them at our fingertips. That's promising.</p>

              <summary><p>When the Skin Deep demo came out, I had to look at Bluesky to see how people were reacting to it. It's been fun to see people enjoying it, but the experience reminded me very sharply of why I quit using microblogging services in the first place.</p>
<p>I won't rant about the specifics here, because I am so sure you have seen the same critiques on other blogs and possibly even on Bluesky or twitter itself. But the experience was enough to reaffirm my decision to cease regularly using these services or posting on them.</p>
<p>Current crises, both national and global, are completely emotionally draining. It is immensely terrifying to have so much exposure to news about harm, and so little agency to do anything to protect myself or my friends. But it's even more difficult to stick your head into <em>the soulscream funnel</em> and also suck down an absolutely endless, on-demand torrent of stress and despair that other people are experiencing about these same things. I do not find that it teaches me anything about these events or even about my own emotional reaction to them. I and my friends already share quite a lot of news and despair about these things with one another. I am not sure that <em>chugging the whole glass</em> of misery here is really teaching me anything that I didn't already learn when I experienced these emotions myself, or saw my closer friends experiencing them.</p>
<p>I think that after Skin Deep ships I will find it easy to stop looking at these services. It's the format that's the problem. If we were sharing these things with one another through a forum, the experience would be very different. The required active engagement with threads in a forum UI, the reverse-chronological thread list, the search features, and the pagination and so on are all very important parts of the formula. They give you more opportunities to disengage, or to read some contextualizing information, or to think.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, however, people don't have time to think. I've begun to wonder recently whether people would still use social media services in the way they do if they just had more leisure time. I've been thinking back to what it was like when I used twitter a lot, and I was filling interstitial moments with that behavior. My leisure time was shredded up into loads of tiny scraps, and that's how I was filling it.</p>
<p>But it goes both ways: since I stopped using those services, it feels like I have MORE leisure time. I don't, really, but I'm spending more time doing things that it's easier for me to disengage from. And being able to disengage from something is really quite relaxing. It's lovely to just be able to <em>stop.</em></p>

              <summary><p>DeepSeek.</p>
<p>Everyone in the LLM space knows that name now, and for good reason; after a little over a year of their team quietly iterating on architecture, engineering, &amp; data work, they've finally caught up to [and in some aspects surpassed] the frontier with the release of DeepSeek r1, fresh off the heels of their latest pretraining run (DeepSeek-V3).</p>
<p>When OpenAI released the first checkpoint that they felt confident enough in to dub a &quot;reasoning model&quot; (o1-preview), speculation went wild trying to figure out what training advancement was responsible for the performance lift that was being observed. Nobody in academia <em>truly</em> reproduced something at this level out in the open for several months. Not until r1 arrived.</p>
<h3>So how did they do it?</h3>
<p>Some individuals speculated that the advancement here came from integration of algorithms that have seen success in other contexts when it comes to ML, such as Monte Carlo tree search, or schemes that involved process reward modeling where each step is individually rewarded.</p>
<p>It turns out all those galaxy brain schemes were beaten out by a clear answer;</p>
<h2><em>literally any reasonable variant of online reinforcement learning applied to verifiable objectives.</em></h2>
<p>While frontier labs at large are [presumably] still using PPO for online RL, DeepSeek developed what can be argued as strictly inferior from a pure learning perspective; but the reason why this doesn't matter is that the core principle of optimization essentially remains the same between the two methods.</p>
<p>It turns out that custom RL objectives which <em>explicitly</em> reward the criteria that you are looking for are <em>vastly</em> more important for strong grounding in the task compared to just doing a finetune over the data you have and hoping for the best. But some elements of the PPO algorithm are more important than the others for the objectives we're aiming to optimize for.</p>
<p>The crux of what actually matters that distinguishes PPO and GRPO is that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GRPO avoids the complexity associated with having a value model estimate the &quot;usefulness&quot; (advantage) of a sample [when it comes to optimizing for a goal] by <strong>weighing the samples according to how much they contribute to the reward.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>I won't get too much into the woods when it comes to the math here because that shit bores me to death, but the important thing about this setup is that <em>since you are already taking multiple generations per training sample in a online RL setup</em>, you can use the natural variability of these samples to estimate your advantage simply by comparing them to each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, if generation 1 has a reward of 0.5, and generations 2, 3, and 4 are 0.1, you want to favor the probability of producing generation 1 more than the others, and by doing this in an relative fashion iteratively, <strong>you can naturally hill climb your desired metric</strong> by always favoring the samples that are proximally closer to improving your desired reward.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/9eaiys.png" alt="" />
<em>What's most critical to observe here is how the advantage is calculated relative to performance of other attempts in the group.</em></p>
<p>The advantage for each of the generations is calculated as such:</p>
<p><code>advantage = (reward - mean) / stddev</code></p>
<h3>DPO Delenda Est, or: The Bitterer Lesson</h3>
<p>For a year or so before r1's release, open source was infatuated with the idea of &quot;DPO&quot; (Direct Preference Optimization), which eschews the &quot;online&quot; nature of reinforcement learning entirely by attempting to maximize the distance between &quot;chosen&quot; and &quot;rejected&quot; data given a pre-existing dataset.</p>
<p>That is to say, instead of generating responses and iteratively improving them, DPO trains on an offline dataset and maximizes the probabilistic distance between chosen and rejected response pairs.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that this seems to have held back some pretty trivial experimentation that could have been done in the open source space to make online RL cheaper in the same ways that DeepSeek has demonstrated with GRPO as an algorithm, and to be blunt, I don't believe that DPO as an idea was ever going to work out in the long term.</p>
<p>So, why doesn't DPO &quot;work&quot; (for the kinds of problems that GRPO is good at handling)? Well, if you think about it, it's essentially a proxy objective <em>for another proxy objective</em>; that being, preference reward models, which are classifiers trained to predict the chance that a response is &quot;preferred&quot; compared to the chance that it is &quot;dispreferred&quot; (Bradley-Terry model).</p>
<p>We cannot directly &quot;train&quot; on &quot;true&quot; human preferences, because what people like more or what is considered subjectively better on average is not typically contingent on verifiable or measurable factors; so we use the reward model as a proxy of determining what would be liked more based off of human annotated preference data.</p>
<p>When you remove a model of preferences from the equation, you are essentially just maximizing the difference between what is already likely to happen vs what is less likely to happen; and as such, methods like DPO can <strong>never</strong> generalize from a base model, and will never learn the &quot;true distribution&quot; of what is preferred. As such, DPO is considered an &quot;offline&quot; version of RL; instead of learning to produce iteratively better outcomes &quot;on the fly&quot;, the model gets prescribed pre-packaged predictions that might not even naturally align with the profile of what the model is predisposed towards producing to begin with.</p>
<p>In fact, it can lead to performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting when the chosen/rejected data being used is simply too far away from what the model actually produces.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, what the model &quot;puts out&quot; will always be shifting across the course of training, so even pre-collecting your chosen and rejected data according to a preference model or classifier will lead to &quot;stale&quot; representations of what the trained model would actually produce compared to if you trained the model in an online fashion.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/pel92z.png" alt="" />
<em>womp womp! (for a more rigorous analysis of DPO vs online RL methods like PPO, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10719">Duan et al. (2024))</a></em></p>
<h3>The (Design) Philosophical Difference</h3>
<p>Another (non-technical) problem this caused was an implicit assumption that optimizing for preference is more important than optimizing for outcome-based objectives; that it's the only approach that matters. In reality, I would argue that the utility of RL for language models has been pigeonholed not by technological limitations but by <em>aspirational ones</em>.</p>
<p>The most useful thing about online RL, the thing about it that makes it so unbelievably powerful when correctly applied to these models at scale, is that you do not have to operate in the space of &quot;optimizing for more accurate token predictions&quot;.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>When it comes to whatever metric you have chosen for your reward in online RL.</p>
<h3>- If you can accurately measure it,</h3>
<h2>- and the model is already capable of accomplishing it to <em>some</em> degree,</h2>
<h4>- at least <em>some</em> of the time...</h4>
<p>...then you essentially have a &quot;soft guarantee&quot; of sorts, that you'll be able to iteratively optimize in the direction of maximizing it.</p>
<p>Of course, you're bound to the intrinsic limits of that metric (see the existence of reward gaming), but if you have a metric that is guaranteed to always be correct, such as mathematical accuracy...</p>
<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/d9yuh6.png" alt="" />
<em>from (almost) zero to hero!</em></p>
<p>Then you now have a direct path towards meaningful improvement.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental thing about policy gradients that makes them capable of turning a model that nearly never gets something right into a model that can one-shot complex problems reliably. In RL, you're not learning from data directly so much as you are learning from the <em>continued direction of improvement</em> in achieving what the reward metric implies.</p>
<p>This essentially gives you the ability to model the <em>process</em> of learning, instead of just observing the outcomes achieved by those who've already learned (which I am analogizing SFT-based finetuning as being equivalent to here).</p>
<p>What GRPO and r1 should teach people more broadly is that, while modeling the process of learning to achieve a goal may be difficult, if you do it correctly, it'll <strong>always</strong> get you more reliable and generalizable results compared to just imitating a known outcome.</p>
<p>It just so happens that pretraining on trillions of tokens of human articulation via &quot;outcome approximation&quot; is the fastest way towards imbuing intelligent prior understanding into these models. But in order to get them to achieve abstract goals like &quot;reliably producing working Python code&quot;, you need to define metrics that (when optimized for) necessarily <em>imply</em> those kinds of outcomes.</p>
<p>You're never going to get that exclusively from plain reduction of cross-entropy over text.</p>
<p>But you can sure as hell get the starting point for it from that.</p>
