                <p>&nbsp;While we were out walking on Sunday, my wife and I had the following exchange:</p><p><b>W.:</b>,"What does 'Zimmer' mean in German?"<br /><b>I</b>: "room".&nbsp; <br /><b>W.: </b>"What does Zimmermann mean?"<br /><b>I: </b>"Carpenter. Hmm."</p><p>&nbsp;A look at <a href="https://woerterbuchnetz.de/?sigle=DWB&amp;lemid=Z06562">the Grimms' dictionary</a> shows that "Zimmer" derives from roots cognate with the English "timber", and originally applied to buildings of wood and to wood suitable for building, then to portions of such a building. So a Zimmermann would be just who one needed to build a Zimmer.</p><p>And I don't know why it occurred to my wife to ask. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;It turns out that our network manager signed us up for certificates for the period 2013 through 2026. Evidently this means that we are grandfathered in for the one-year certificate duration. One of his successors received and verified the request for 2025-2026, then sent me the certificate bundle. I have applied the certificates to most of the servers that need it: two are very slow to come up after the installation and restart of the processes, and so are waiting for an early morning.</p><p>Suddenly the weeks leading up to mid-March are much less stressful. We have another year to think about how we will manage with the three-month certificates.</p>

                <p>Web server certificates used to last one for three years, I recall. Our network administrator would send a request to GoDaddy, get back a certificate, and it would be up to others of us to install it, possibly with some change of format, on the assorted servers. I thought that the three-year span was convenient. It gave one enough time to forget the procedures, but with proper documentation that didn't matter.</p><p>At some point, GoDaddy shortened the life of certificates to one year. That was tolerable. Last year, I read that the standard length of certificates would be three months, and so it is. This is great if you can set up LetsEncrypt with the http challenge, and let the certbot take over. If you can't, then life becomes somewhat more complicated. I suppose that we will figure out the dns challenge instead. But I wish we didn't have to. Is it really plausible to suppose that a certificate can be defeated in one year but not in three months? And there are proposals to shorten the lifetimes still further. Oh, dear.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;Galen Strawson's <i>The Secret Connexion: Causation, Realism, and David Hume</i> gives page numbers for its quotations from Hume in the manner (T 266) or (E 153), referring to particular Clarendon Press editions of Hume's works. It happens that I have the edition he uses for <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i>, which in Part II, Causation in the <i>Treatise</i>, I did refer to at times. Having reached, Part III, Causation in the <i>Enquiry</i>, I went to find my copy, doubting I had the one used. I did not: I had an edition printed by Bobbs-Merrill.</p><p>Curiously, Bobb-Merrill printed it as <i>An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding.</i> On page lv, "A Note on the Text" concludes</p><blockquote><p>Spelling and punctuation have been revised throughout to conform to present-day American usage.</p></blockquote><p>And so it has. For example the edition replaces with "insure" the "ensure" in <br /></p><blockquote><p>The poorest artificer, who labours alone, expects at least the protection of the magistrate, to ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour.<br /></p></blockquote><p>And of course it removes the "u" from "labour". </p><p>This strikes me as just wrong. It is well to impose present-day American spelling on present-day American authors; though Jacques Barzun thought otherwise about publishers' conventions, as he wrote in the essay "Dialogue in C-Sharp", collected in <i>A Word or Two Before You Go...: Brief Essays on Language</i>. But though Bobbs-Merrill's market consisted of present-day Americans, its author was not one. I have to think that anyone capable of following the arguments of<i> An Enquiry</i> can manage English or Scottish spelling and an older system of punctuation.<br /></p><p>It is fair to say that the edition appeared in 1955. Quite likely practices had changed with twenty or thirty years at Bobbs-Merrill and comparable publishers.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;In checking a term in Liddell and Scott, I was interested to see "pankalkeos" defined as "all-brazen", being used to think of "kalkos" (χαλκός) as meaning primarily "bronze". And indeed in the main article on "kalkos", the lexicon says that antiquity did not know what we call brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. But evidently the ancients were loose in their designations, sometimes using "kalkos" for unalloyed copper, sometimes for what we call bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. The Romans were likewise free in their use of "aes". No doubt the purchasers of metal products were quite precise in specifying what they wanted and in checking what they received, though.<br /></p><p>"Brass" does not quite sound as impressive as "bronze". Partly I suppose this owes to I Corinthians 13, partly to the colloquial use of "brass" for money or for effrontery. But it was the term that earlier English made do with, and that is why the Authorized Version used "brass" for "kalkos". The OED's earliest citation for "bronze" in the modern sense is from 1739; and in 1755 Johnson used "brass" in his definition of bronze.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;Last week, the New York Times carried an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/03/books/david-lodge-dead.html">obituary</a> of David Lodge, who died on New Years at the age of 89. Going through Wikipedia's list of his works, I find that I have read four of his novels, including his most recent, <a href="https://dc20011.blogspot.com/2024/08/deaf-sentence.html"><i>Deaf Sentence</i></a>, which appeared in 2006. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Alvin Kernan's memoir <i>In Plato's Cave</i> states that Stanley Fish cheerfully acknowledged that Lodge had modeled the character Morris Zapp (<i>Changing Places</i> and <i>Small World</i>) on him. The Times says that Fish put a Morris Zapp nameplate on his office door at Duke. That seems to me to speak well for Fish's sense of humor, and for Lodge's touch.<br /></p>

                <p>One sees here and there the tag "habent libelli sua fata", "books have their fates". They do, and it has seemed to me that more and more it is a very quick fate--the Homeric epithet "okumoros", swift-fated, seems to apply. The book that was everywhere in 2010 became a special order in 2020, and now is simply unavailable at most stores.</p><p>A look through the best-seller lists of other years shows that the process is not always unfair, that many books deserve their quick disappearance. But there are others that deserve to be on the shelves and stay. Having looked into Sam Tanenhaus's biography of Whittaker Chambers, I thought it might be interesting to look into Lionel Trilling's novel <i>The Middle of the Journey</i>. The most likely local bookstore says that this is "not available"--NYRB Classics brought it back into print in 2002, but that was two dozen years ago. I gave a friend a copy of Hermann Broch's novel <i>The Death of Virgil</i> some years ago, but that also is not available. Well, Vintage brought it out 30 years ago. And apart from books never bought, there are those that one wishes to replace--lost by a loan, or to household disasters.<br /></p><p><a href="https://www.powells.com/book/beginning-latin-poetry-reader-9780071458856">A textbook</a> tells me that that the full clause is "pro captu lectoris habent libelli sua fata": books have their fates, according to the reader's ability. Fortunately, the ability of the reader is not fixed, and I have read with much interest books that I had set aside years before that as unreadable or uninteresting.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;In Chapter XI, "The Conqueror (1837)" of <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/across-the-wide-missouri-9780395083741"><i>Across the Wide Missouri</i></a>, Bernard DeVoto wrote of the American Fur Company's earnest but ineffectual response to the 1837 smallpox epidemic that devastated the tribes along the upper Missouri River:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose however that [the company] had the knowledge of every American today--except the million or so who belong to anti-vaccination, anti-vivisection, anti-research organizations and sometimes produce smallpox epidemics which differ from that which destroyed the Mandans only in that the rest of have been vaccinated...<br /></p></blockquote><p>A page or so later DeVoto suggested the rural south as at least a recent area of resistance to vaccines. Such resistance had not become popular among the prosperous and expensively schooled.</p><p><i>Across the Wide Missouri</i> appeared in 1947, and won a Pulitzer Prize and a Bancroft Prize.<br /></p>

                <p>When the effect of age on my eyes was beyond denying, the optometrist suggested progressive lenses, saying that they worked well for those who worked with computers. I found that this was so. I also found drawbacks. Steps down required care until I was used to the glasses. Distance vision was best at a narrow strip across the top of the lenses, which sometimes made me tuck my chin down to see a block or two down the street.</p><p>This time, with the distance band having moved a few degrees down, I thought that I should try bifocals. I got them on Monday. For distance they were excellent. For reading print they were good. For computer work they were deficient.

                <p>&nbsp;In <i>The English Constitution</i>, Bagehot makes a case for the superiority of the British cabinet system over the American. When I read this, I was not really convinced, and may not be now. However, it appears to me that as the federal government has expanded--as the cabinet has expanded, and one might say diffused--the cabinet has lost power.</p><p>The third through fifth presidents of the United States had served in the Cabinet, and Van Buren and Buchanan after them. That I can recall, the next member of a Cabinet to become president was Herbert Hoover. The Roosevelts topped out at sub-cabinet level, as Assistant Secretaries of the Navy. George H. W. Bush was director of the CIA, but long before that post came to be part of the Cabinet.</p><p>Since the earliest days of the republic, there have been complaints of the president ignoring the Cabinet and taking advice elsewhere. Henry Adams quoted John Randolph in a speech of 1806:</p><blockquote><p>The first question I asked when I saw the gentleman's resolution was, Is this a measure of the Cabinet? Not of an open declared Cabinet, but of an invisible, inscrutable, unconstitutional Cabinet, without responsibility, unknown to the Constitution. I speak of back-stairs influence-of men who bring messages to this House, which although they do not appear in the Journals, govern its decisions. Sir, the first question that I asked on the subject of British relations was, What is the opinion of the Cabinet; what measures will they recommend to Congress?--well knowing that whatever measures we might take they must execute them, and therefore that we should have their opinion on the subject. My answer was (and from a Cabinet minister, too), '<i>There is no longer any Cabinet!'</i></p></blockquote><p>(The Cabinet then included James Madison and Albert Gallatin; but Randolph disliked Madison, and may have been disenchanted with Gallatin as impossible to intimidate. In any case, Randolph's quarrel had to do with the President as much as the Cabinet.) I remember accounts fifty years ago of Richard Nixon ignoring his Secretary of State in favor of Henry Kissinger, then his National Security Advisor. Have matters changed at all?<br /></p><p>It is said that the President elect's last cabinet considered declaring him unable to continue under the fourth section of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, and did not. It is also said that the current President's staff kept the Cabinet away from the President and unable to judge his state. Perhaps Bagehot was right.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;This summer, I ordered a copy of <i>Mental Acts: Their Content and Their Object</i> by Peter Geach. I was mildly surprised to find that it was a reproduction of the edition published by Routledge, Kegan, and Paul. The back cover said, among other things, that</p><blockquote><p>This work is in the public domain in the United States of America, and possibly other nations. Within the United States, you may freely copy and distribute this work, as no entity (individual or corporate) has a copyright on the body of the work.<br /></p></blockquote><p>I find it odd that the writings of philosophers should somehow reach the public domain so quickly, when Disney's "Steamboat Willy" only made it into the public domain this year. I have made the same <a href="https://dc20011.blogspot.com/2019/02/willard-walt-and-copyright.html">complaint</a> of a copied edition of Quine's <i>Word and Object</i>. Disney died in 1966, Quine in 2000, Geach in 2013. Yet somehow Disney' works of the 1930s remain protected, while Quine's and Geach's works of the 1950s and 1960s are not.<br /></p><p>The copy of <i>Mental Acts</i> also suggests objections to the attitude of those who think that quick entry to the public domain is wholly beneficial. This week I looked into the book to find its date of publication. The publishers had included a page with a little bit of library information from Osmania University, which must once have owned the copy scanned. But they had omitted whatever portion of the front matter included the publication date. The best I could do from the book was to establish a terminus a quo of 1953, the year of the last-cited publications. Wikipedia says that it appeared in 1957.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;Last Monday, I discovered that my driver's license had expired on my birthday, roughly three weeks ago. It was not practical for me to go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) during the week, because of the press of business.The DMV offices keep barbers' days, Tuesday through Saturday, and I decided on Saturday.<br /></p><p>On Saturday, I considered taking the bus, given my unlicensed state. But Georgetown is within fifteen minutes by car, and could take an hour and half to reach by bus on a Saturday. I drove, which was prudent. I left a book behind, which may not have been.</p><p>An hour and ten minutes elapsed between my arrival at the reception desk and my exit with a temporary license. A book might have helped to occupy me, or might have been impossible to read, given the unceasing sound track that posted one on almost anything one might need to know about the DMV.</p><p>This office is in a small shopping mall, with a restaurant or two. The woman next to me agreed that the mall should get permission for its shops to display the readout showing the state of the queues for service. I could see the numbers for a driver's license paid for by credit card creep up from C134 to C147 (my number). Had the readout been visible in the shops or restaurants, I could have browsed the displays or sipped coffee until C144 was called.</p><p>I find that for my next license, when I will be (well) over seventy, I will need to find a physician to certify that I am sound of mind and body. The DMV calls this the "mature driver" portion of the form. I hope that I reached maturity as a driver some time ago, but it has never been certified.</p><p>(During the last few years, people have started to use the term "DMV" as designating the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. After so many years of using for a Department of Motor Vehicles--not just DC's, but Maryland's, I find this disconcerting.)</p><p><br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;This year I did a fairly bad job of carving a jack o'lantern. I marked off the features with an indelible marker, then decided that they were too low. I carelessly cut across the top of the mouth, not outlining the teeth. As a consequence, Jack has badly applied eye-black (and mouth-black), and a couple of dental implants. Of course, in the dark that doesn't matter much.</p><p>&nbsp;It occurred to me, though, that I had a large, sound pumpkin, with room enough to carve another face on the back side--a Janus-faced pumpkin. One could carve contrasting faces, say masks of tragedy and comedy. Or one could just cut out a mediocre jack o'lantern face, not better or worse, nor deliberately different. Yet I wonder whether the cross-draft would burn down the candle faster. Perhaps I will carve such a jack o'lantern next year.</p>

                <p>Metro trains stop for perhaps thirty seconds when running properly. Earlier in the month, in a fraction of that time, I found myself looking at an advertising display on the Union Station platform, where I saw at least three, and perhaps four advertisements for schools: Rochester Institute of Technology, the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, and something from George Washington University--perhaps the Elliot School of International Affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;The next time that I was in a Metro station, to add money to a SmartTrip card, I noticed advertising on the walls and the floor from the George Washington University College of Continuing Studies. If I occasionally forget to local thirst for credentials, I am reminded soon enough again.<br /></p>

                <p>The local tomato season, the period during which one can buy good, local tomatoes grown outdoors, is now over. In the Washington, DC, area, the season begins about the beginning of July and now runs until about the middle of October. Of course one can buy tomatoes in the stores all year, but they are bred for shipping rather than for eating: they will not bruise under reasonable handling; they have very little taste.</p><p>During the tomato season, my wife will come home with bags from a local farmers market. We will have a dinner of bacon, lettuce, and tomato (BLT) sandwiches many weeks. Most Fridays we will have roasted tomatoes over fettucini. She has frozen some roasted tomatoes for a treat to be enjoyed between now and next July. The BLTs, though, are over until then.</p><p>&nbsp;The night this year after she first brought home bags of tomatoes, I woke in the dark hours thinking that I smelled smoke. Of course the smoke alarms are more sensitive than a nose, certainly more sensitive than mine, but that did not occur to me. After walking about the house and sniffing, I went back to bed. In the morning it occurred to me that it was the unfamiliar smell of fresh tomatoes that I had taken for smoke. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

Wittgenstein did, of course, write a plain and beautiful German; the difficulty for the non-philosopher, reading his later works, is not in construing particular sentences, but in understanding the point of saying any of the things he said. With Aristotle it is the other way round; it is clear that what he is saying is of immense importance, but the problem is to discover what meaning it has, or which of the seven possible meanings is the intended one.<br /></p></blockquote><p>Well, I have read a very little bit of Wittgenstein in German, and cannot testify to the plainness or beauty of his prose. I am grateful to the translators who wrestle with the difficulties of Aristotle.</p><p>A page or so later in the book there appears</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Bertrand Russell was one of those who accused Aquinas of not being a real philosopher because he was looking for reasons for what he already believed. It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book <i>Principia Mathematica</i> takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life.<br /></p></blockquote><p>At first glance that seems a little unfair to Russell, but is it?<br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;There must be households that possess automobiles over many decades without encountering collisions and requiring auto-body repairs. We are not one. Over about 35 years as a household, we have had four trips to a body shop for repairs.</p><p>It was after the most recent visit, to Imperial Auto Body in northwest Washington, DC, that it occurred to me that our work has been parceled out between that establishment and Royal Auto Body of Rockville, Maryland. So far--and I hope that there will be no further--the score stands at three visits to Imperial, one to Royal.

This is not something I have heard of elsewhere. It is tempting to suspect that Aristotle had dark eyes. People used to suspect and perhaps still do that he had a snub nose, for more than once in his works he asserts that a snub nose is not a defect.</p><p>In <i>Naples '44</i>, Norman Lewis writes that in WW II the career of one who had finished a preliminary course in military intelligence was determined before the placement interview had officially begun: the blue-eyed got the demanding, interesting, and--to be fair--more dangerous assignments. The dark-eyed were sent off to be sergeants in Field Security. My stepmother (herself blue-eyed) once remarked that the heroes and heroines in Helen MacInnes's novels of suspense always had blue eyes; though I suppose that some of their opponents must have had blue eyes, given that they tended to be Germans or Russians.</p><p>I don't know where Aristotle would have placed my eye color on the range from black to blue. My driver's license calls them brown, the mirror suggests that hazel or green might suit better. (Be their color what it may, I don't see well without glasses.) The word Kenny renders as "blue" is "glaukos".&nbsp; Liddell and Scott say that as applied to eyes this means blue or light blue--otherwise it seems to shade toward green.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;Last month, the Sunday New York Times Book Review carried a piece by David Brooks on Tom Wolfe. This was part or all of an introduction Brooks wrote to a volume comprising Wolfe's pieces "Radical Chic" and "Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers". Two weeks later, there were two letters about the piece, one praising Wolfe, and one putting in a good word for the Bernsteins. Nobody addressed what I thought the strangest few paragraphs.</p><p>It appears that the old WASP world of Manhattan could trace its ancestry to Debrett's Peerage or the Almanach de Gotha:</p><blockquote><p>The old aristocrats had it so easy, those stately bankers in the J.P. Morgan mold. They may have been frequently bewildered about why the masses didn’t like them, but their own place in the social aristocracy was secure. It was right there in their bloodlines — the generations of grandees stretching back centuries. The status rules were simple.</p></blockquote><p>But the names offered do not convince:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;the old blue-blood Protestant elite — the Astors, the Whitneys, the Rockefellers</p></blockquote><p>John Jacob Astor, founder of the family, was the son of a butcher. John D. Rockefeller's father was not especially reputable. The Whitneys went a good way back in the northeastern US, yet I suspect that the reflective among them would have agreed with Mrs. Archer in <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/541/pg541.txt">The Age of Innocence</a></i>:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"Don't tell me," Mrs. Archer would say to her children, "all this
modern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy.  If there is one, neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it; no, nor the Newlands or the Chiverses either.  Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants, who came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because they did so well.  One of your great-grandfathers signed the Declaration, and another was a general on Washington's staff, and received General Burgoyne's sword after the battle of Saratoga.  These are things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or class.  New York has always been a commercial community, and there are not more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word."</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Whatever the case, the new families did not have it so easy:</p><blockquote><p>The members of the new cultural elite could never be so secure. Their 
status — their very reason for being — was based on their own superior 
sensibility. They lived by their wits and their public attitudes.</p></blockquote><p>That sixty years ago in the Midwest I heard of Leonard Bernstein had nothing to do with his superior sensibility, except so far as it was reflected in his composing and directing music. I knew no more of his public attitudes than of George Szell's. (Of Szell's I knew only that he thought very poorly of persons arriving late at concerts.)</p><p>Then a few weeks later, the print edition carried a review by Jennifer Szalai of <i>Hitler's People: The Faces of the Third Reich.</i> There I was interested to read of<br /></p><blockquote><p>the easy lie of a noxious conspiracy theory in place of the hard truth, 
that Germany was incapable of defeating the Anglo-American coalition.</p></blockquote><p>The French losses in World War I were about 15% greater than those of the British Empire; the American losses were not a tenth of the French. And Russia may have suffered more casualties than France. If any crank wrote to complain about the salience of the Anglo-American coalition, the letter did not make it into the Book Review.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;If you watched American television sixty years ago, almost certainly you heard Kodak commercials using the song "Try to Remember [that time in September]". That song came from the musical "The Fantasticks". The lyricist, Tom Jones, died last month.</p><p>I remember very little of the song, but I read with interest the obituary of Mr. Jones in The New York Times. In particular there was his account of his high school, and early college years in Texas:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“Sometime during my sophomore year at Coleman High School, I became a ‘character’” — wearing bow ties and a straw hat to school, smoking a pipe, signing his articles for the school newspaper “T. Collins Jones, Esquire.”
<br /><br />
“Even now, nearly 70 years later, I can’t help but stop and wonder what the hell I thought I was doing,” he wrote. “Even more, I wonder at the fact that the other kids — farmers mostly, and ranchers and 4-H girls — took it all in their stride."</p></blockquote><p>But then he got to the drama department of the University of Texas, where</p><blockquote><p>"for the first time, there were other people actually like me," he wrote. "Here, marvel of marvels, everybody was T. Collins Jones, Esquire."<br /></p></blockquote><p>It is well that he found his tribe.</p><p>One understands the wish for distinction. An American can grow up in a homogeneous world, one of so many so much alike, and feel an urge to stand out from the crowd. In <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3251/3251-h/3251-h.htm#link2H_4_0019">"My Military Campaign"</a>, Mark Twain mentioned a young neighbor, who</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;had some pathetic little nickel-plated aristocratic instincts, and detested his name, which was Dunlap; detested it, partly because it was nearly as common in that region as Smith, but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to his ear. So he tried to ennoble it by writing it in this way: d’Unlap. That contented his eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave the new name the same old pronunciation—emphasis on the front end of it. He then did the bravest thing that can be imagined—a thing to make one shiver when one remembers how the world is given to resenting shams and affectations; he began to write his name so: d’Un Lap. And he waited patiently through the long storm of mud that was flung at this work of art, and he had his reward at last; for he lived to see that name accepted, and the emphasis put where he wanted it, by people who had known him all his life, and to whom the tribe of Dunlaps had been as familiar as the rain and the sunshine for forty years. So sure of victory at last is
      the courage that can wait.</p></blockquote>

                <p>&nbsp;Seated at the airport gate not far from us early Monday was a young woman with a sweatshirt obviously from a well thought of university. On the back were Aeneas's words "haec olim meminisse iuvabit", from Book I of the Aeneid, <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0055%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D198">line 203</a>. <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D198">Theodore C. Williams</a> translates the full sentence, "forsan et haec meminisse juvabit",<br /></p><blockquote><p>.... It well may be<br />
some happier hour will find this memory fair</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;My first thought was that this made the university experience sound a bit dire: the memory of which Aeneas speaks includes near shipwreck, certain loss of one ship of his fleet, and apparent loss of others. One could argue that the omission of the first two words of the sentence "forsan et"--perhaps even--turns the sentence from a tentative encouragement to a positive statement. But in the years when all students arrived at the university knowing their Latin, wouldn't they have at once thought of the context? Perhaps I underrate their sense of irony, though.<br /></p><p>My second, somewhat later thought, was that No, I would not relate with pleasure the annoyance of a four-hour delay. It is less than Roman virtue to say so. But we were not out to found a city, only to take a vacation.<br /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;A few weeks ago, I received a notice from a local store stating that the registration fee for the DC Half Marathon was about to go up. I am not in condition to run the race, but I thought I would see what the price was. At the time, it was $100, now it is $110.</p><p>That seemed to me pretty steep. I haven't entered many races since the mid-1980s, and I am unable to say what registration costs were then. I'm guessing that I usually paid about $20 or $25 for a race. Back then, that would have been about a third of the price of a pair of good running shoes. This suggests that the fees have outrun inflation, for running shoes costing more than $250 are unusual.</p><p>The one race that I have run since 1987 is a local 5-kilometer race. I find that this year's fee is $20. At $4/kilometer, that isn't much lower than the price per kilometer of the DC Half. But were shorter races less expensive to enter than marathons in the old days? I just don't remember.</p><p>In fairness, there are some features now expected that weren't imagined in 1980s, notably bibs with microchips and the timing mats to record one's finish time and splits. Finisher's medals seem to be expected now, at least for marathons: then I think I got just one, for finishing in the top <i>n</i> of the Richmond Newspapers Marathon. Perhaps some races offer other swag as well, beyond the tee shirt one got in the old days.<br /></p>

                <p>At work I spend a good deal of time logging into this or that system. Often these days such a system requires more than a username and password, uses what is called multi-factor authentication (MFA). In many cases I use Google Authenticator on my phone for this--I find that I have nine applications using it, plus one application that we no longer use, and for which I should remove the entry. Google Authenticator will provide a six-digit code for an application, which code changes at short intervals.<br /></p><p>A couple of the applications that require MFA will bring up a page where one may enter the code, but then do not set the "focus" to the input box. This means that one can confidently type the six-digit code, look at the box, and find that there is nothing there. In such cases, one clicks in the box, waits for the numbers on the phone to change, and types in the new code. I find this annoying, out of proportion to the real inconvenience.</p><p>One of the applications for which I get authenticator codes is Okta. An Okta login sequence always sets the focus properly for the code. Now, Okta's whole business is to centralize authentication for its customers, so you would expect them to have put thought into these matters. Anyway, good for them.</p><p>It is not only in HTML inputs that developers neglect focus. Recently I have been adding comments to some database objects, using Oracle SQL Developer. Once in ten times I will click on the comment tab of the window and start typing, having failed to remember that the focus is still with the object name above the tabs, and so wiping that out. It is hard to do damage this way, for a comment will not match the allowed format of an object name. Still, one must close the window without saving and start over.<br /></p>
