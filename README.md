## FAQ

1. What's an RSS feed?

For a full explanation check out Ali Reza Hayati's [full blog post](https://alirezahayati.com/2021/09/11/what-is-rss-really-simple-syndication/).

In short:

> RSS is basically a web feed that is readable by computers. A web feed is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. It means that whenever the blog or news feed gets updated, the user can receive the update in user’s feed aggregator.

> With RSS, subscribing doesn’t need email! You won’t be asked to give away your email address to any blog or site, and that site won’t be able to sell your data to anyone. RSS just simply visits or opens the blog’s RSS file and checks for new writings or media, and will show it to you in a human-readable way.
